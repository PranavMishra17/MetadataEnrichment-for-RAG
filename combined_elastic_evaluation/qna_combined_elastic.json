With the REST \nAPI, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.\nTo use the REST API, you can use any toolkit that supports HTTP. You can even use a browser to \nfetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable.\nThe REST API uses standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard browsers and \ntoolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality to HTTP (for example, we \nadded headers to support access control). In these cases, we have done our best to add the new \nfunctionality in a way that matches the style of standard HTTP usage.\nIf you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to compute the \nsignature and add it to the request.

S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud object storage class \navailable today, with data access speeds up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 percent lower \nthan S3 Standard. S3 Express One Zone is the ﬁrst S3 storage class where you can select a single \nAvailability Zone with the option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, \nwhich provides the highest possible access speed. Additionally, to further increase access speed \nand support hundreds of thousands of requests per second, data is stored in a new bucket type: an \nAmazon S3 directory bucket. For more information, see Directory buckets and S3 Express One Zone\nand Directory buckets overview.\nYou can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which \noptimizes storage costs by automatically moving your data between four access tiers when your \naccess patterns change.

You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements \nthat require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection \nagainst object changes and deletions.\n•S3 Replication – Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more \ndestination buckets in the same or diﬀerent AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, \nsecurity, and other use cases.\nStorage management API Version 2006-03-01 2",

For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to \ndownload and install them, see Tools for AWS.\nEvery interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous.

You can access S3 and AWS programmatically \nby using the Amazon S3 REST API. The REST API is an HTTP interface to Amazon S3. With the REST \nAPI, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.\nTo use the REST API, you can use any toolkit that supports HTTP. You can even use a browser to \nfetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable.\nThe REST API uses standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard browsers and \ntoolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality to HTTP (for example, we \nadded headers to support access control). In these cases, we have done our best to add the new \nfunctionality in a way that matches the style of standard HTTP usage.\nIf you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to compute the \nsignature and add it to the request.

You can store any number of objects in \na bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account. To see your bucket utilization, bucket \nquota, or request an increase, visit the Service Quotas console.\nFor a list of restriction and limitations related to Amazon S3 buckets see, Bucket quotas, \nrestrictions, and limitations.\nEvery object is contained in a bucket. For example, if the object named photos/puppy.jpg\nis stored in the amzn-s3-demo-bucket  bucket in the US West (Oregon) Region, \nthen it is addressable by using the URL https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.us-\nwest-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg . For more information, see Accessing a Bucket.\nIn terms of implementation, buckets and objects are AWS resources, and Amazon S3 provides \nAPIs for you to manage them. For example, you can create a bucket and upload objects using the \nAmazon S3 API. You can also use the Amazon S3 console to perform these operations. The console \nuses the Amazon S3 APIs to send requests to Amazon S3.\nThis section describes how to work with buckets.

Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size.\nBucket policies use JSON-based access policy language that is standard across AWS. You can use \nbucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny \nrequests based on the elements in the policy, including the requester, S3 actions, resources, and \naspects or conditions of the request (for example, the IP address used to make the request). For \nexample, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross-account permissions to upload objects \nto an S3 bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control of the uploaded objects. For \nmore information, see Examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies.\nIn your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters on Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and \nother values to grant permissions to a subset of objects. For example, you can control access to \ngroups of objects that begin with a common preﬁx or end with a given extension, such as .html .\nS3 Access Points\nAmazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that \ndescribe how data can be accessed using that endpoint.

    "answer": "The different types of retrieval options available in S3 Glacier and their recommended use cases are:\n\n1. **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**:  \n   - **Use Case**: Ideal for long-term data that's accessed once per quarter and requires millisecond retrieval times. Suitable for performance-sensitive use cases such as image hosting, file-sharing applications, and storing medical records for access during appointments.  \n   - **Key Features**: Offers real-time access with the same latency and throughput performance as the S3 Standard-IA storage class. Lower storage costs compared to S3 Standard-IA but higher data access costs.  \n\n2. **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**:  \n   - **Use Case**: Recommended for archive data that's accessed one to two times a year and doesn't require immediate access. Suitable for backup and disaster recovery.  \n   - **Key Features**: Provides flexible retrieval times ranging from a few minutes to hours, with free bulk retrievals.

Objects that already existed in the bucket at the time that you \nenable versioning have a version ID of null. If you modify these (or any other) objects with other \noperations, such as CopyObject and PutObject, the new objects get a unique version ID.\nFor more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning.\nBucket policy\nA bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you \ncan use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it. Only the bucket owner can \nassociate a policy with a bucket. The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects \nin the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner. Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size.\nBucket policies use JSON-based access policy language that is standard across AWS. You can use \nbucket policies to add or deny permissions for the objects in a bucket. Bucket policies allow or deny \nrequests based on the elements in the policy, including the requester, S3 actions, resources, and \naspects or conditions of the request (for example, the IP address used to make the request). For \nexample, you can create a bucket policy that grants cross-account permissions to upload objects \nto an S3 bucket while ensuring that the bucket owner has full control of the uploaded objects. For \nmore information, see Examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies.\nIn your bucket policy, you can use wildcard characters on Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and \nother values to grant permissions to a subset of objects. For example, you can control access to \ngroups of objects that begin with a common preﬁx or end with a given extension, such as .html .\nS3 Access Points\nAmazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that \ndescribe how data can be accessed using that endpoint. Access Points are attached to buckets \nthat you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject. Access Points \nsimplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in Amazon S3.\nEach access point has its own access point policy. You can conﬁgure Block Public Access settings for \neach access point. To restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network, you can also conﬁgure \nany access point to accept requests only from a virtual private cloud (VPC).\nFor more information, see Managing access to shared datasets with access points.\nVersion ID API Version 2006-03-01 8",

You can also perform most bucket operations by using the console UI, \nwithout having to write any code.\n•AWS CLI: If you need to access multiple buckets, you can save time by using the AWS \nCommand Line Interface (AWS CLI) to automate common and repetitive tasks. Scriptability and \nrepeatability for common actions are frequent considerations as organizations scale. For more \ninformation, see Developing with Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI in the Amazon S3 API Reference.\n•Amazon S3 REST API: You can use the Amazon S3 REST API to write your own programs and \naccess buckets programmatically. Amazon S3 supports an API architecture in which your buckets \nand objects are resources, each with a resource URI that uniquely identiﬁes the resource. For \nmore information, see Developing with Amazon S3 in the Amazon S3 API Reference.\nDepending on the use case for your Amazon S3 bucket, there are diﬀerent recommended methods \nto access the underlying data in your buckets. The following list includes common use cases for \naccessing your data.\n•Static websites – You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website.

S3 Express One Zone is the lowest latency cloud object storage class \navailable today, with data access speeds up to 10x faster and with request costs 50 percent lower \nthan S3 Standard. S3 Express One Zone is the ﬁrst S3 storage class where you can select a single \nAvailability Zone with the option to co-locate your object storage with your compute resources, \nwhich provides the highest possible access speed. Additionally, to further increase access speed \nand support hundreds of thousands of requests per second, data is stored in a new bucket type: an \nAmazon S3 directory bucket. For more information, see Directory buckets and S3 Express One Zone\nand Directory buckets overview.\nYou can store data with changing or unknown access patterns in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, which \noptimizes storage costs by automatically moving your data between four access tiers when your \naccess patterns change. These four access tiers include two low-latency access tiers optimized for \nfrequent and infrequent access, and two opt-in archive access tiers designed for asynchronous \naccess for rarely accessed data.\nFor more information, see Understanding and managing Amazon S3 storage classes.\nStorage management\nAmazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory \nrequirements, reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance \nrequirements.\n•S3 Lifecycle – Conﬁgure a lifecycle conﬁguration to manage your objects and store them cost \neﬀectively throughout their lifecycle. You can transition objects to other S3 storage classes or \nexpire objects that reach the end of their lifetimes.\n•S3 Object Lock – Prevent Amazon S3 objects from being deleted or overwritten for a ﬁxed \namount of time or indeﬁnitely. You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory requirements \nthat require write-once-read-many (WORM) storage or to simply add another layer of protection \nagainst object changes and deletions.\n•S3 Replication – Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more \ndestination buckets in the same or diﬀerent AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, \nsecurity, and other use cases.\nStorage management API Version 2006-03-01 2",

The API call you use to upload \nan archive in parts is referred as Multipart Upload. For more information, see Uploading an Archive \nin Amazon S3 Glacier.\nImportant\nS3 Glacier provides a management console. You can use the console to create and delete \nvaults. However, all other interactions with S3 Glacier require that you use the AWS \nCommand Line Interface (CLI) or write code. For example, to upload data, such as photos, \nvideos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or write code to make \nrequests, using either the REST API directly or by using the Amazon SDKs. For more \ninformation about using S3 Glacier with the AWS CLI, go to AWS CLI Reference for S3 \nGlacier . To install the AWS CLI, go to AWS Command Line Interface.\nFinding an Archive ID in Amazon S3 Glacier\nYou can get the archive ID by downloading the vault inventory for the vault that contains the \narchive. For more information about downloading the vault inventory, see Downloading a Vault \nInventory in Amazon S3 Glacier.\nDownloading an Archive in Amazon S3 Glacier\nDownloading an archive is an asynchronous operation. You must ﬁrst initiate a job to download \na speciﬁc archive. After receiving the job request, S3 Glacier prepares your archive for download. \nAfter the job completes, you can download your archive data. Because of the asynchronous nature \nof the job, you can request S3 Glacier to send a notiﬁcation to an Amazon Simple Notiﬁcation \nService (Amazon SNS) topic when the job completes. You can specify an SNS topic for each \nindividual job request or conﬁgure your vault to send a notiﬁcation when speciﬁc events occur.

You can create and manage customer-managed keys or use AWS-managed keys that are unique to your service, Region, and use case.\n\nTo use SSE-KMS, you must specify the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header with a value of `aws:kms` in your request. If this header is used, the following additional headers may also be required:\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id`: Specifies the ID of the AWS KMS key used to encrypt the object. This is required if the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header is set to `aws:kms`.\n- `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context`: Specifies the encryption context for the object as a base64-encoded UTF-8 string containing JSON-formatted key-value pairs.

The default option for server-side \nencryption is with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). Each object is encrypted with a unique key. \nAs an additional safeguard, SSE-S3 encrypts the key itself with a root key that it regularly rotates. \nSSE-S3 uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard \n(AES-256), to encrypt your data. For more information, see Using server-side encryption with \nAmazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).\nServer-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys (SSE-KMS)\nServer-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS) is provided through an integration of the \nAWS KMS service with Amazon S3.

For \nexample, you can view separate keys, edit control policies, and follow the keys in AWS CloudTrail. \nAdditionally, you can create and manage customer managed keys or use AWS managed keys that \nare unique to you, your service, and your Region.

Because both \nlayers of encryption are applied to an object on the server side, you can use a wide range of AWS \nservices and tools to analyze data in S3 while using an encryption method that can satisfy your \ncompliance requirements. For more information, see Using dual-layer server-side encryption with \nAWS KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).\nServer-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)\nWith server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C), you manage the encryption keys, \nand Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and the decryption when you access \nyour objects.

Below are examples in different programming languages based on the provided context.\n\n---\n\n### **Using AWS SDK for .NET**\n\n1. **Set Up the S3 Client**: Create an `IAmazonS3` client object.\n2. **Use a Paginator**: Use the `ListObjectsV2` paginator to retrieve objects in the bucket.\n3. **Iterate Through Responses**: Loop through the paginated responses and log the object details.\n\n```csharp\npublic static async Task ListingObjectsAsync(IAmazonS3 client, string bucketName)\n{\n    var listObjectsV2Paginator = client.Paginators.ListObjectsV2(new ListObjectsV2Request\n    {\n        BucketName = bucketName,\n    });\n\n    await foreach (var response in listObjectsV2Paginator.Responses)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"HttpStatusCode: {response.HttpStatusCode}\");\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Number of Keys: {response.KeyCount}\");\n        foreach (var entry in response.S3Objects)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Key = {entry.Key} Size = {entry.Size}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Using AWS SDK for Java 2.x**\n\n1. **Set Up the S3 Client**: Use the `S3Client` to interact with S3.\n2. **Create a Paginator**: Use the `ListObjectsV2Paginator` to handle paginated results.\n3. **Log Object Keys**: Iterate through the responses and log the object keys.\n\n```java\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model.ListObjectsV2Request;\nimport software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.paginators.ListObjectsV2Iterable;\n\npublic class ListObjectsPaginated {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        S3Client s3 = S3Client.create();\n        ListObjectsV2Request request = ListObjectsV2Request.builder()\n            .bucket(\"your-bucket-name\")\n            .build();\n\n        ListObjectsV2Iterable responses = s3.listObjectsV2Paginator(request);\n\n        for (var response : responses) {\n            response.contents().forEach(s3Object -> {\n                System.out.println(\"Object key: \" + s3Object.key());\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Using AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3)**\n\n1. **Set Up the S3 Client**: Use the `S3Client` from the AWS SDK for JavaScript.\n2. **Use the `paginateListObjectsV2` Function**: This function supersedes the older `ListObjectsCommand` and is the recommended way to list objects.\n3. **Iterate Through Pages**: Loop through the paginated results and log the object keys.\n\n```javascript\nimport { S3Client, paginateListObjectsV2 } from \"@aws-sdk/client-s3\";\n\nexport const main = async ({ bucketName, pageSize }) => {\n  const client = new S3Client({});\n  try {\n    const paginator = paginateListObjectsV2(\n      { client, pageSize: Number.parseInt(pageSize) },\n      { Bucket: bucketName }\n    );\n\n    for await (const page of paginator) {\n      page.Contents.forEach((object) => {\n        console.log(`Object key: ${object.Key}`);\n      });\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(\"Error listing objects:\", error);\n  }\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- **Pagination**: All examples use paginators to handle large result sets efficiently.\n- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error handling in your implementation to manage exceptions like `S3Exception` or runtime errors.\n- **API References**: For more details, refer to the respective SDK documentation for `.NET`, `Java`, or `JavaScript`.\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to list objects in an S3 bucket using the `ListObjectsV2` API with pagination in different programming languages.",

Choose Create replication rules to create and save your new one-way replication rule.\nCreate two-way replication rules for your Multi-Region Access Point\nReplication rules enable automatic and asynchronous copying of objects across buckets. A two-\nway replication rule (also known as a bidirectional replication rule) ensures that data is fully \nsynchronized between two or more buckets in diﬀerent AWS Regions. When two-way replication \nis set up, a replication rule from the source bucket (DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-1) to the bucket \ncontaining the replicas (DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2) is created. Then, a second replication rule \nfrom the bucket containing the replicas (DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET-2) to the source bucket (DOC-\nEXAMPLE-BUCKET-1) is created.\nLike all replication rules, you can apply the two-way replication rule to the entire Amazon S3 \nbucket or to a subset of objects ﬁltered by a preﬁx or object tags. You can also keep metadata \nchanges to your objects in sync by enabling replica modiﬁcation sync for each replication rule.

Objects consist of object data and \nmetadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These pairs include \nsome default metadata, such as the date last modiﬁed, and standard HTTP metadata, such as\nContent-Type . You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.\nAn object is uniquely identiﬁed within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID (if S3 Versioning is \nenabled on the bucket). For more information about objects, see Amazon S3 objects overview.\nKeys\nAn object key  (or key name ) is the unique identiﬁer for an object within a bucket. Every object in a \nbucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if \nS3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object. So you can think of Amazon \nS3 as a basic data map between \"bucket + key + version\" and the object itself.\nEvery object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service \nendpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL https:// amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket .s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg , amzn-s3-demo-\nbucket is the name of the bucket and photos/puppy.jpg  is the key.\nFor more information about object keys, see Naming Amazon S3 objects.\nS3 Versioning\nYou can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. With S3 \nVersioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your \nbuckets. You can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.\nFor more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning.\nObjects API Version 2006-03-01 7",

Categorizing your \nresources is not only useful for organizing them, but you can also set access management rules \nbased on the resource categories. In particular, preﬁxes and tagging are two storage organization \nfeatures that you can use when setting access management permissions.\nNote\nThe following information applies to general purpose buckets. Directory buckets do not \nsupport tagging, and they have preﬁx limitations. For more information, see Authorizing \nRegional endpoint APIs with IAM.\n•Preﬁxes — A preﬁx in Amazon S3 is a string of characters at the beginning of an object key name \nthat's used to organize the objects that are stored in your S3 buckets. You can use a delimiter \ncharacter, such as a forward slash (/), to indicate the end of the preﬁx within the object key \nname. For example, you might have object key names that start with the engineering/  preﬁx \nor object key names that start with the marketing/campaigns/  preﬁx. Using a delimeter at \nthe end of your preﬁx, such as as a forward slash character / emulates folder and ﬁle naming \nconventions. However, in S3, the preﬁx is part of the object key name. In general purpose S3 \nbuckets, there is no actual folder hierarchy.\nAmazon S3 supports organizing and grouping objects by using their preﬁxes. You can also \nmanage access to objects by their preﬁxes. For example, you can limit access to only the objects \nwith names that start with a speciﬁc preﬁx.\nFor more information, see Organizing objects using preﬁxes. S3 Console uses the concept of\nfolders , which, in general purpose buckets, are essentially preﬁxes that are pre-pended to the \nobject key name. For more information, see Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console by \nusing folders .\n•Tags — Each tag is a key-value pair that you assign to resources. For example, you can tag some \nresources with the tag topicCategory=engineering . You can use tagging to help with cost \nallocation, categorizing and organizing, and access control. Bucket tagging is only used for cost \nallocation. You can tag objects, S3 Storage Lens, jobs, and S3 Access Grants for the purposes of \norganizing or for access control. In S3 Access Grants, you can also use tagging for cost-allocation. \nAs an example of controlling access to resources by using their tags, you can share only the \nobjects that have a speciﬁc tag or a combination of tags.\nS3 resources API Version 2006-03-01 814",

To access an archived \nobject, you must ﬁrst initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived \nobject. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to \nexist. After the speciﬁed period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains \narchived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from.\nTo restore a speciﬁc object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, \nAmazon S3 restores the current version.\nThe time it takes restore jobs to ﬁnish depends on which storage class the object is being restored \nfrom and which data access tier you specify.\nWhen restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following \ndata access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:\n•Expedited  - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER \nstorage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but \nthe largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically \nmade available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for \nExpedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity \nare not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.\n•Standard  - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several \nhours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do \nnot specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the \nGLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage \nclass.\n•Bulk - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to \nretrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically \ncomplete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 \nhours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.\nFor more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited  data \naccess, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\nYou can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed \nwhile it is in progress.

Before you block all public access, make sure that your applications will \ncontinue to work correctly without public access. For more information, see Blocking public access \nto your Amazon S3 storage.\nYou can also review your bucket-level permission settings to conﬁgure detailed levels of access. For \nspeciﬁc and veriﬁed use cases that require public or shared access, you can acknowledge and record \nyour intent for the bucket to remain public or shared by archiving the ﬁndings for the bucket. \nYou can revisit and modify these bucket conﬁgurations at any time. You can also download your \nﬁndings as a CSV report for auditing purposes.\nIAM Access Analyzer for S3 is available at no extra cost on the Amazon S3 console.

    "answer": "To set up a Multi-Region Access Point for an S3 bucket to handle cross-region traffic, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**: Open the Amazon S3 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).\n\n2. **Navigate to Multi-Region Access Points**: In the left navigation pane, choose \"Multi-Region Access Points.\"\n\n3. **Create or Configure the Multi-Region Access Point**:\n   - If creating a new Multi-Region Access Point, follow the instructions provided in the console.\n   - If configuring an existing Multi-Region Access Point, select its name to view and manage its configuration details.\n\n4. **Associate Buckets**:\n   - Add the S3 buckets you want to associate with the Multi-Region Access Point. If the bucket is owned by another account, ensure the bucket owner updates their bucket policy to grant access permissions to the Multi-Region Access Point.\n\n5. **Set Up Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**:\n   - Configure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to synchronize data between the associated buckets. This ensures consistent datasets across regions and avoids potential 404 errors when a request is routed to a bucket that does not contain the requested data.\n\n6. **Enable Bucket Versioning** (Optional but Recommended):\n   - Turn on bucket versioning and include version IDs in your requests to ensure the correct version of the object is retrieved and to recover objects from accidental overwrites.\n\n7. **Review Permissions**:\n   - Check the \"Permissions\" tab to view and manage Block Public Access settings and the Multi-Region Access Point policy. Ensure the necessary permissions, such as `s3:GetBucketReplication`, are granted for external buckets.\n\n8. **Monitor Replication and Failover**:\n   - Use the \"Replication and failover\" tab to view a map of the associated buckets and their regions. This tab also provides replication metrics, rules, and failover statuses.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a Multi-Region Access Point to handle cross-region traffic effectively.",

        "content": "Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide\nAfter the Multi-Region Access Point routes the request to the closest-proximity bucket, Amazon S3 \nprocesses the request as if you made it directly to that bucket. Multi-Region Access Points aren't \naware of the data contents of an Amazon S3 bucket. Therefore, the bucket that gets the request \nmight not contain the requested data. To create consistent datasets in the Amazon S3 buckets that \nare associated with a Multi-Region Access Point, you can conﬁgure S3 Cross-Region Replication \n(CRR). Then any bucket can fulﬁll the request successfully.\nAmazon S3 directs Multi-Region Access Point requests according to the following rules:\n•Amazon S3 optimizes requests to be fulﬁlled according to proximity. It looks at the buckets \nsupported by the Multi-Region Access Point and relays the request to the bucket that has the \nclosest proximity.\n•If the request speciﬁes an existing resource (for example, GetObject ), Amazon S3 does not\nconsider the name of the object when fulﬁlling the request. This means that even if an object \nexists in one bucket in the Multi-Region Access Point, your request can be routed to a bucket that \ndoesn't contain the object. This situation will result in a 404 error message being returned to the \nclient.\nTo avoid 404 errors, we recommend that you conﬁgure S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for \nyour buckets. Replication helps resolve the potential issue when the object that you want is in \na bucket in the Multi-Region Access Point, but it's not located in the speciﬁc bucket that your \nrequest was routed to. For more information about conﬁguring replication, see Conﬁguring \nreplication for use with Multi-Region Access Points.\nTo ensure that your requests are fulﬁlled by using the speciﬁc objects that you want, we also \nrecommend that you turn on bucket versioning and include version IDs in your requests. This \napproach helps ensure that you have the correct version of the object that you are looking for. \nVersioning-enabled buckets can also help you recover objects from accidental overwrite. For \nmore information, see Using S3 Versioning in S3 buckets.\n•If the request is to create a resource (for example, PutObject  or CreateMultipartUpload ), \nAmazon S3 fulﬁlls the request by using the closest-proximity bucket. For example, consider a \nvideo company that wants to support video uploads from anywhere in the world. When a user \nmakes a PUT request to the Multi-Region Access Point, the object is put into the bucket with \nthe closest proximity. To then make that uploaded video available to others around the world \nfor download with the lowest latency, you can use CRR with bidirectional (two-way) replication. \nUsing CRR with two-way replication keeps the contents of all the buckets that are associated \nwith the Multi-Region Access Point synchronized.

AWS Regions provide \nmultiple, physically separated and isolated Availability Zones that are connected with low latency, \nhigh throughput, and highly redundant networking. These Availability Zones oﬀer you an eﬀective \nway to design and operate applications and databases. They are more highly available, fault \ntolerant, and scalable than traditional single data center infrastructures or multi-data center \ninfrastructures. If you speciﬁcally need to replicate your data over greater geographic distances, \nyou can use Replicating objects within and across Regions, which enables automatic, asynchronous \ncopying of objects across buckets in diﬀerent AWS Regions.\nEach AWS Region has multiple Availability Zones. You can deploy your applications across multiple \nAvailability Zones in the same Region for fault tolerance and low latency. Availability Zones are \nconnected to each other with fast, private ﬁber-optic networking, enabling you to easily architect \napplications that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption.\nFor more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see AWS Global Infrastructure.\nIn addition to the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon S3 oﬀers several features to help support \nyour data resiliency and backup needs.\nLifecycle conﬁguration\nA lifecycle conﬁguration is a set of rules that deﬁne actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group \nof objects.

For general S3 pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing and the\nAWS Pricing Calculator.\n•Lifecycle transition costs\nEach time an object is transitioned to a diﬀerent storage class by a lifecycle rule, Amazon S3 \ncounts that transition as one transition request. The costs for these transition requests are in \naddition to the costs of these storage classes. If you plan to transition a large number of objects, \nconsider the request costs when transitioning to a lower tier. For more information, see Amazon \nS3 pricing .\nI’ve updated my bucket policy, but my S3 objects are still being deleted by \nexpired lifecycle rules.\nDeny statements in a bucket policy don't prevent the expiration of the objects deﬁned in a \nlifecycle rule. Lifecycle actions (such as transitions or expirations) don't use the S3 DeleteObject\noperation. Instead, S3 Lifecycle actions are performed by using internal S3 endpoints. (For more \ninformation, see Lifecycle and logging.)\nTo prevent your lifecycle rule from taking any action, you must edit, delete, or disable the rule .\nCan I recover S3 objects that are expired by S3 Lifecycle rules?\nThe only way to recover objects that are expired by S3 Lifecycle is through versioning, which must \nbe in place before the objects become eligible for expiration. You cannot undo the expiration \noperations that are performed by lifecycle rules. If objects are permanently deleted by the S3 \nLifecycle rules that are in place, you cannot recover these objects. To enable versioning on a bucket, \nsee the section called “Retaining multiple versions of objects”.\nIf you have applied versioning to the bucket and the noncurrent versions of the objects are still \nintact, you can restore previous versions of the expired objects. For more information about the \nbehavior of S3 Lifecycle rule actions and versioning states, see the Lifecycle actions and bucket \nversioning state  table in Elements to describe lifecycle actions.\nTroubleshooting lifecycle issues API Version 2006-03-01 1909",

Objects consist of object data and \nmetadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These pairs include \nsome default metadata, such as the date last modiﬁed, and standard HTTP metadata, such as\nContent-Type . You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.\nAn object is uniquely identiﬁed within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID (if S3 Versioning is \nenabled on the bucket). For more information about objects, see Amazon S3 objects overview.\nKeys\nAn object key  (or key name ) is the unique identiﬁer for an object within a bucket. Every object in a \nbucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if \nS3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object. So you can think of Amazon \nS3 as a basic data map between \"bucket + key + version\" and the object itself.\nEvery object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service \nendpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL https:// amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket .s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg , amzn-s3-demo-\nbucket is the name of the bucket and photos/puppy.jpg  is the key.\nFor more information about object keys, see Naming Amazon S3 objects.\nS3 Versioning\nYou can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. With S3 \nVersioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your \nbuckets. You can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.\nFor more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning.\nObjects API Version 2006-03-01 7",

The S3 Standard storage class is more cost-\neﬀective.\nFor durability, RRS objects have an average annual expected loss of 0.01 percent of objects. If an \nRRS object is lost, when requests are made to that object, Amazon S3 returns a 405 error.\nStorage class for automatically optimizing data with changing or \nunknown access patterns\nS3 Intelligent-Tiering is an Amazon S3 storage class that's designed to optimize storage costs by \nautomatically moving data to the most cost-eﬀective access tier, without performance impact or \noperational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the only cloud storage class that delivers automatic \ncost savings by moving data on a granular object level between access tiers when access patterns \nchange. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class when you want to optimize storage \ncosts for data that has unknown or changing access patterns. There are no retrieval fees for S3 \nIntelligent-Tiering.\nFor a small monthly object monitoring and automation fee, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access \npatterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed to lower-cost access tiers. \nS3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic storage cost savings in three low-latency and high-\nthroughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose to activate \nautomatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent-\nTiering is designed for 99.9% availability and 99.999999999% durability.\nS3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically stores objects in three access tiers:\n•Frequent Access – Objects that are uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are \nautomatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.\n•Infrequent Access – S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves objects that have not been accessed in 30 \nconsecutive days to the Infrequent Access tier.\n•Archive Instant Access – With S3 Intelligent-Tiering, any existing objects that have not been \naccessed for 90 consecutive days are automatically moved to the Archive Instant Access tier.\nAutomatically optimizing data with changing or unknown access patterns API Version 2006-03-01 1781",

Categorizing your \nresources is not only useful for organizing them, but you can also set access management rules \nbased on the resource categories. In particular, preﬁxes and tagging are two storage organization \nfeatures that you can use when setting access management permissions.\nNote\nThe following information applies to general purpose buckets. Directory buckets do not \nsupport tagging, and they have preﬁx limitations. For more information, see Authorizing \nRegional endpoint APIs with IAM.\n•Preﬁxes — A preﬁx in Amazon S3 is a string of characters at the beginning of an object key name \nthat's used to organize the objects that are stored in your S3 buckets. You can use a delimiter \ncharacter, such as a forward slash (/), to indicate the end of the preﬁx within the object key \nname. For example, you might have object key names that start with the engineering/  preﬁx \nor object key names that start with the marketing/campaigns/  preﬁx. Using a delimeter at \nthe end of your preﬁx, such as as a forward slash character / emulates folder and ﬁle naming \nconventions. However, in S3, the preﬁx is part of the object key name. In general purpose S3 \nbuckets, there is no actual folder hierarchy.\nAmazon S3 supports organizing and grouping objects by using their preﬁxes. You can also \nmanage access to objects by their preﬁxes. For example, you can limit access to only the objects \nwith names that start with a speciﬁc preﬁx.\nFor more information, see Organizing objects using preﬁxes. S3 Console uses the concept of\nfolders , which, in general purpose buckets, are essentially preﬁxes that are pre-pended to the \nobject key name. For more information, see Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console by \nusing folders .\n•Tags — Each tag is a key-value pair that you assign to resources. For example, you can tag some \nresources with the tag topicCategory=engineering . You can use tagging to help with cost \nallocation, categorizing and organizing, and access control. Bucket tagging is only used for cost \nallocation. You can tag objects, S3 Storage Lens, jobs, and S3 Access Grants for the purposes of \norganizing or for access control. In S3 Access Grants, you can also use tagging for cost-allocation. \nAs an example of controlling access to resources by using their tags, you can share only the \nobjects that have a speciﬁc tag or a combination of tags.\nS3 resources API Version 2006-03-01 814",
