Guide\nThis page is only for existing customers of the S3 Glacier service using Vaults and the original \nREST API from 2012.\nIf you're looking for archival storage solutions we suggest using the S3 Glacier storage classes \nin Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep \nArchive. To learn more about these storage options, see S3 Glacier storage classes  and Long-term \ndata storage using S3 Glacier storage classes  in the Amazon S3 User Guide . These storage classes \nuse the Amazon S3 API, are available in all regions, and can be managed within the Amazon S3 \nconsole. They o\ufb00er features like Storage Cost Analysis, Storage Lens, advanced optional encryption \nfeatures, and more.\nAPI Version 2012-06-01 xAmazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nWhat Is Amazon S3 Glacier?\nIf you're currently using the Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) service and want to learn more, you'll \n\ufb01nd the information that you need in this guide. S3 Glacier is a secure and durable service for low-\ncost data archiving and long-term backup using vaults. For more information about S3 Glacier \nservice pricing, see S3 Glacier pricing .\nTopics\n\u2022Do You Currently Use S3 Glacier?\n\u2022Amazon S3 Glacier Data Model\n\u2022Supported Operations in S3 Glacier\n\u2022Accessing Amazon S3 Glacier\nDo You Currently Use S3 Glacier?\nNote\nThis section is about the S3 Glacier service. If you currently use the S3 Glacier storage \nclasses ( S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep \nArchive), see Storage classes for archiving objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\nIf you currently use the S3 Glacier service and want to learn more, we recommend that you begin \nby reading the following sections:\n\u2022What is Amazon S3 Glacier \u2013 The rest of this section describes the underlying data model, the \noperations it supports, and the AWS SDKs that you can use to interact with the service.\n\u2022Getting Started \u2013 The Getting Started with Amazon S3 Glacier section walks you through the \nprocess of creating a vault, uploading archives, creating jobs to download archives, retrieving the \njob output, and deleting archives.\nImportant\nS3 Glacier does provide a console. However, any archive operation, such as upload, \ndownload, or deletion, requires you to use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) \nDo You Currently Use S3 Glacier? API Version 2012-06-01 1Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nor write code.", "There is no console support for archive operations.", "For example, to upload \ndata, such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use the AWS CLI or \nwrite code to make requests, by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS \nSDKs.\nTo install the AWS CLI, see AWS Command Line Interface.", "For more information about \nusing S3 Glacier with the AWS CLI, see the AWS CLI Reference for S3 Glacier. For \nexamples of using the AWS CLI to upload archives to S3 Glacier, see Using S3 Glacier with \nthe AWS Command Line Interface.\nBeyond the getting started section, you'll probably want to learn more about S3 Glacier \noperations. The following sections provide detailed information about working with S3 Glacier by \nusing the REST API and the AWS SDKs for Java and Microsoft .NET:\n\u2022Using the AWS SDKs with Amazon S3 Glacier\nThis section provides an overview of the AWS SDKs used in various code examples in this guide.", "\nA review of this section will help when reading the following sections.", "It includes an overview \nof the high-level and the low-level APIs that these SDKs o\ufb00er, when to use them, and common \nsteps for running the code examples provided in this guide.\n\u2022Working with Vaults in Amazon S3 Glacier\nThis section provides details of various vault operations, such as creating a vault, retrieving vault \nmetadata, using jobs to retrieve vault inventory, and con\ufb01guring vault noti\ufb01cations. In addition \nto using the S3 Glacier console, you can use the AWS SDKs for various vault operations. This \nsection describes the API and provides working samples by using the AWS SDK for Java and the \nAWS SDK for .NET.\n\u2022Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier\nThis section provides details of archive operations, such as uploading an archive in a single \nrequest or using a multipart upload operation to upload large archives in parts.", "The section also \nexplains how to create jobs to download archives asynchronously.", "The section provides examples \nby using the AWS SDK for Java and the AWS SDK for .NET.\n\u2022API Reference for Amazon S3 Glacier\nDo You Currently Use S3 Glacier? API Version 2012-06-01 2Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nS3 Glacier is a RESTful service.", "This section describes the REST operations, including the syntax, \nand example requests and responses for all the operations.", "The AWS SDK libraries wrap this API, \nsimplifying your programming tasks.\nAmazon S3 Glacier Data Model\nThe Amazon S3 Glacier data model core components include vaults and archives. S3 Glacier is \na REST-based web service.", "In terms of REST, vaults and archives are the resources.", "In addition, \nthe S3 Glacier data model includes job and noti\ufb01cation-con\ufb01guration resources. These resources \ncomplement the core resources.\nTopics\n\u2022Vault\n\u2022Archive\n\u2022Job\n\u2022Noti\ufb01cation Con\ufb01guration\nVault\nIn S3 Glacier, a vault  is a container for storing archives. A vault is similar to an Amazon S3 bucket. \nWhen you create a vault, you specify a name and choose an AWS Region where you want to create \nthe vault.\nEach vault resource has a unique address. The general form is:\nhttps:// region-specific-endpoint /account-id /vaults/ vault-name\nFor example, suppose that you create a vault (examplevault ) in the US West (Oregon) Region in \nyour account with the ID 111122223333. You can address this vault by using the following URI:\nhttps://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/111122223333/vaults/examplevault\nHere is what the various components of the URI mean:\n\u2022glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com  identi\ufb01es the US West (Oregon) Region.\n\u2022111122223333  is the AWS account ID that owns the vault.\nData Model API Version 2012-06-01 3Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\n\u2022vaults refers to the collection of vaults that are owned by the AWS account.\n\u2022examplevault  identi\ufb01es a speci\ufb01c vault in the vaults collection.\nAn AWS account can create vaults in any supported AWS Region.", "For list of supported AWS \nRegions, see Accessing Amazon S3 Glacier.", "Within a Region, an account must use unique vault \nnames. An AWS account can create same-named vaults in di\ufb00erent Regions.\nYou can store an unlimited number of archives in a vault.", "Depending on your business or \napplication needs, you can store these archives in one vault or multiple vaults.\nS3 Glacier supports various vault operations.", "Vault operations are Region-speci\ufb01c. For example, \nwhen you create a vault, you create it in a speci\ufb01c Region. When you request a vault list, you \nrequest it from a speci\ufb01c AWS Region, and the resulting list includes only vaults created in that \nspeci\ufb01c Region.\nArchive\nAn archive  can be any data, such as a photo, video, or document.", "An archive is similar to an Amazon \nS3 object, and is the base unit of storage in S3 Glacier.", "Each archive has a unique ID and an \noptional description. You can specify this optional description only during the upload of an archive.", "\nS3 Glacier assigns the archive an ID, which is unique in the AWS Region in which the archive is \nstored.\nEach archive has a unique address. The general form is as follows:\nhttps:// region-specific-endpoint /account-id /vaults/ vault-name /archives/ archive-id\nThe following is an example URI of an archive stored in the examplevault  vault in the US West \n(Oregon) Region in account 111122223333:\nhttps://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/111122223333/vaults/\nexamplevault/archives/NkbByEejwEggmBz2fTHgJrg0XBoDfjP4q6iu87-\nTjhqG6eGoOY9Z8i1_AUyUsuhPAdTqLHy8pTl5nfCFJmDl2yEZONi5L26Omw12vcs01MNGntHEQL8MBfGlqrEXAMPLEArchiveId\nYou can store an unlimited number of archives in a vault.\nJob\nAn S3 Glacier job can retrieve an archive, or get an inventory of a vault.\nArchive API Version 2012-06-01 4Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nRetrieving archives and vault inventories (lists of archives) are asynchronous operations in S3 \nGlacier, in which you \ufb01rst initiate a job, and then download the job output after S3 Glacier \ncompletes the job.\nNote\nS3 Glacier o\ufb00ers a cold-storage data-archival solution.", "If your application needs a storage \nsolution that requires real-time data retrieval, you might consider using Amazon S3. For \nmore information, see Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\nTo initiate a vault inventory job, you provide a vault name.", "Archive retrieval jobs require both the \nvault name and the archive ID. You can also provide an optional job description to help identify the \njobs.\nArchive retrieval and vault inventory jobs are associated with a vault. A vault can have multiple jobs \nin progress at any point in time.", "When you send a job request (initiate a job), S3 Glacier returns to \nyou a job ID to track the job. Each job is uniquely identi\ufb01ed by a URI of the form:\nhttps:// region-specific-endpoint /account-id /vaults/ vault-name /jobs/job-id\nThe following is an example of a job associated with an examplevault  vault in the US West \n(Oregon) Region in account 111122223333.\nhttps://glacier.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/111122223333/vaults/examplevault/jobs/\nHkF9p6o7yjhFx-\nK3CGl6fuSm6VzW9T7esGQfco8nUXVYwS0jlb5gq1JZ55yHgt5vP54ZShjoQzQVVh7vEXAMPLEjobID\nFor each job, S3 Glacier maintains information, such as the job type, description, creation date, \ncompletion date, and job status. You can obtain information about a speci\ufb01c job or obtain a list \nof all your jobs associated with a vault.", "The list of jobs that S3 Glacier returns includes all the in-\nprogress and recently \ufb01nished jobs.\nNoti\ufb01cation Con\ufb01guration\nBecause jobs take time to run, S3 Glacier supports a noti\ufb01cation mechanism to notify you when a \njob is completed.", "You can con\ufb01gure a vault to send a noti\ufb01cation to an Amazon Simple Noti\ufb01cation \nService (Amazon SNS) topic when a job is completed.

For a list of the AWS Regions \nsupported by S3 Glacier, see  Amazon S3 Glacier endpoints and quotas in the AWS General \nReference.\nYou can delete a vault only if there are no archives in the vault as of the last inventory that S3 \nGlacier computed and if there have been no writes to the vault since the last inventory.\nNote\nS3 Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. Because the \ninventory might not re\ufb02ect the latest information, S3 Glacier ensures that the vault is \nindeed empty by checking if there were any write operations since the last vault inventory.\nFor more information, see Creating a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier and Deleting a Vault in Amazon \nS3 Glacier .\nRetrieving Vault Metadata\nYou can retrieve vault information such as the vault creation date, number of archives in the vault, \nand the total size of all the archives in the vault. S3 Glacier provides API calls for you to retrieve \nthis information for a speci\ufb01c vault or all the vaults in a speci\ufb01c AWS Region in your account. For \nmore information, see Retrieving Vault Metadata in Amazon S3 Glacier.\nDownloading a Vault Inventory\nA vault inventory refers to the list of archives in a vault.", "For each archive in the list, the inventory \nprovides archive information, such as the archive ID, creation date, and size.", "S3 Glacier updates \nthe vault inventory once a day, starting on the day that the \ufb01rst archive is uploaded to the vault. A \nvault inventory must exist for you to be able to download it.\nVault Operations in S3 Glacier API Version 2012-06-01 36Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nDownloading a vault inventory is an asynchronous operation.", "You must \ufb01rst initiate a job to \ndownload the inventory.", "After receiving the job request, S3 Glacier prepares your inventory for \ndownload.", "After the job is completed, you can download the inventory data.\nGiven the asynchronous nature of the job, you can use Amazon Simple Noti\ufb01cation Service \n(Amazon SNS) noti\ufb01cations to notify you when the job is completed.", "You can specify an Amazon \nSNS topic for each individual job request or con\ufb01gure your vault to send a noti\ufb01cation when \nspeci\ufb01c vault events occur.\nS3 Glacier prepares an inventory for each vault periodically, every 24 hours. If there have been \nno archive additions or deletions to the vault since the last inventory, the inventory date is not \nupdated.\nWhen you initiate a job for a vault inventory, S3 Glacier returns the last inventory that it generated, \nwhich is a point-in-time snapshot and not real-time data. You might not \ufb01nd it useful to retrieve \nvault inventory for each archive upload.", "However, suppose that you maintain a database on the \nclient-side that contains metadata associated with the archives that you upload to S3 Glacier. In \nthat case, you might \ufb01nd the vault inventory useful to reconcile information in your database with \nthe actual vault inventory.\nFor more information about retrieving a vault inventory, see Downloading a Vault Inventory in \nAmazon S3 Glacier.\nCon\ufb01guring Vault Noti\ufb01cations\nRetrieving anything from S3 Glacier, such as an archive from a vault or a vault inventory, is a two-\nstep process.", "First, you initiate a job. After the job is completed, you download the output.", "To \nlearn when your job is complete, you can use S3 Glacier noti\ufb01cations. S3 Glacier sends noti\ufb01cation \nmessages to an Amazon Simple Noti\ufb01cation Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you provide.\nYou can con\ufb01gure noti\ufb01cations on a vault and identify vault events and the Amazon SNS topic to \nbe noti\ufb01ed when the event occurs. Anytime the vault event occurs, S3 Glacier sends a noti\ufb01cation \nto the speci\ufb01ed Amazon SNS topic. For more information, see Con\ufb01guring Vault Noti\ufb01cations in \nAmazon S3 Glacier.\nCreating a Vault in Amazon S3 Glacier\nCreating a vault adds a vault to the set of vaults in your account.", "An AWS account can create up to \n1,000 vaults per AWS Region.", "For a list of the AWS Regions supported by Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 \nGlacier), see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.\nCon\ufb01guring Vault Noti\ufb01cations API Version 2012-06-01 37Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nWhen you create a vault, you must provide a vault name.", "The following are the vault naming \nrequirements:\n\u2022Names can be between 1 and 255 characters long.\n\u2022Allowed characters are a\u2013z, A\u2013Z, 0\u20139, '_' (underscore), '-' (hyphen), and '.'

You can specify controls such as \"write once read \nmany\" (WORM) in a Vault Lock policy and lock the policy from future edits.\nImportant\nAfter a Vault Lock policy is locked, the policy can no longer be changed or deleted.\nS3 Glacier enforces the controls set in the Vault Lock policy to help achieve your compliance \nobjectives.", "For example, you can use Vault Lock policies to enforce data retention. You can deploy \na variety of compliance controls in a Vault Lock policy by using the AWS Identity and Access \nManagement (IAM) policy language. For more information about Vault Lock policies, see Vault Lock \nPolicies.\nA Vault Lock policy is di\ufb00erent from a vault access policy. Both policies govern access controls to \nyour vault. However, a Vault Lock policy can be locked to prevent future changes, which provides \nstrong enforcement for your compliance controls. You can use the Vault Lock policy to deploy \nregulatory and compliance controls, which typically require tight controls on data access.\nImportant\nWe recommend that you \ufb01rst create a vault, complete a Vault Lock policy, and then upload \nyour archives to the vault so that the policy will be applied to them.\nVault Lock API Version 2012-06-01 99Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nIn contrast, you use a vault access policy to implement access controls that are not compliance \nrelated, temporary, and subject to frequent modi\ufb01cation. You can use Vault lock and vault access \npolicies together. For example, you can implement time-based data-retention rules in the Vault \nLock policy (deny deletes), and grant read access to designated third parties or your business \npartners (allow reads) in your vault access policy.\nLocking a vault takes two steps:\n1.Initiate the lock by attaching a Vault Lock policy to your vault, which sets the lock to an in-\nprogress state and returns a lock ID. While the policy is in the in-progress state, you have 24 \nhours to validate your Vault Lock policy before the lock ID expires. To prevent your vault from \nexiting the in-progress state, you must complete the Vault Lock process within these 24 hours. \nOtherwise, your Vault Lock policy will be deleted.\n2.Use the lock ID to complete the lock process. If the Vault Lock policy doesn't work as expected, \nyou can stop the Vault Lock process and restart from the beginning.", "For information about how \nto use the S3 Glacier API to lock a vault, see Locking a Vault by Using the S3 Glacier API.\nLocking a Vault by Using the S3 Glacier API\nTo lock your vault with the Amazon S3 Glacier API, you \ufb01rst call Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-\npolicy) with a Vault Lock policy that speci\ufb01es the controls that you want to deploy.", "The Initiate \nVault Lock  operation attaches the policy to your vault, transitions the Vault Lock to the in-\nprogress state, and returns a unique lock ID. After the Vault Lock enters the in-progress state, you \nhave 24 hours to complete the lock by calling Complete Vault Lock (POST lockId) with the lock ID \nthat was returned from the Initiate Vault Lock  call.\nImportant\n\u2022We recommend that you \ufb01rst create a vault, complete a Vault Lock policy, and then \nupload your archives to the vault so that the policy will be applied to them.\n\u2022After the Vault Lock policy is locked, it cannot be changed or deleted.\nIf you don't complete the Vault Lock process within 24 hours after entering the in-progress state, \nyour vault automatically exits the in-progress state, and the Vault Lock policy is removed.

This \nmeans that you can use multipart uploads in cases where you don't know the archive \nsize when you start uploading the archive. You only need to decide the part size at the \ntime you start the multipart upload.\nIn the initiate multipart upload request, you can also provide an optional archive description.\n2. Upload Parts\nFor each part upload request, you must include the multipart upload ID you obtained in step \n1.", "In the request, you must also specify the content range, in bytes, identifying the position of \nthe part in the \ufb01nal archive.", "S3 Glacier later uses the content range information to assemble \nthe archive in proper sequence.", "Because you provide the content range for each part that you \nupload, it determines the part's position in the \ufb01nal assembly of the archive, and therefore you \ncan upload parts in any order. You can also upload parts in parallel. If you upload a new part \nusing the same content range as a previously uploaded part, the previously uploaded part is \noverwritten.\n3. Complete (or stop) Multipart Upload\nAfter uploading all the archive parts, you use the complete operation. Again, you must \nspecify the upload ID in your request.", "S3 Glacier creates an archive by concatenating parts in \nascending order based on the content range you provided. S3 Glacier response to a Complete \nMultipart Upload request includes an archive ID for the newly created archive.

All \noperations you perform using this client apply to that AWS Region.\n2.Initiate an archive-retrieval  job by executing the InitiateJob  method.\nYou provide job information, such as the archive ID of the archive you want to download and the \noptional Amazon SNS topic to which you want S3 Glacier to post a job completion message, by \ncreating an instance of the InitiateJobRequest  class. S3 Glacier returns a job ID in response. \nThe response is available in an instance of the InitiateJobResponse  class.\nAmazonGlacierClient client;\nclient = new AmazonGlacierClient(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2);\nInitiateJobRequest initJobRequest = new InitiateJobRequest()\n{ \n  VaultName = vaultName, \nDownloading an Archive Using .NET API Version 2012-06-01 161Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\n  JobParameters = new JobParameters() \n  { \n    Type      = \"archive-retrieval\", \n    ArchiveId = \"*** Provide archive id ***\", \n    SNSTopic  = \"*** Provide Amazon SNS topic ARN ***\", \n  }\n};\nInitiateJobResponse initJobResponse = client.InitiateJob(initJobRequest);\nstring jobId = initJobResponse.JobId;\nYou can optionally specify a byte range to request S3 Glacier to prepare only a portion of the \narchive as shown in the following request.

If you have either set a \nnoti\ufb01cation con\ufb01guration on the vault identifying an Amazon Simple Noti\ufb01cation Service \n(Amazon SNS) topic or speci\ufb01ed an Amazon SNS topic when you initiated a job, S3 Glacier sends \nDownloading an Archive Using .NET API Version 2012-06-01 162Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\na message to that topic after it completes the job. The code example given in the following \nsection uses Amazon SNS for S3 Glacier to publish a message.\nYou can also poll S3 Glacier by calling the DescribeJob  method to determine the job \ncompletion status.", "Although, using an Amazon SNS topic for noti\ufb01cation is the recommended \napproach .\n4.Download the job output (archive data) by executing the GetJobOutput  method.\nYou provide the request information such as the job ID and vault name by creating an instance \nof the GetJobOutputRequest  class.

For more information, see Receiving \nChecksums When Downloading Data.\nTo verify there are no errors in the download, you can then compute the checksum on the client-\nside and compare it with the checksum S3 Glacier sent in the response.\nFor an archive retrieval job with the optional range speci\ufb01ed, when you get the job description, it \nincludes the checksum of the range you are retrieving (SHA256TreeHash).You can use this value \nto further verify the accuracy of the entire byte range that you later download. For example, \nif you initiate a job to retrieve a tree-hash aligned archive range and then download output \nin chunks such that each of your GetJobOutput  requests return a checksum, then you can \ncompute checksum of each portion you download on the client-side and then compute the tree \nhash.", "You can compare it with the checksum S3 Glacier returns in response to your describe job \nrequest to verify that the entire byte range you have downloaded is the same as the byte range \nthat is stored in S3 Glacier.\nFor a working example, see Example 2: Retrieving an Archive Using the Low-Level API of the \nAWS SDK for .NET\u2014Download Output in Chunks.\nExample 1: Retrieving an Archive Using the Low-Level API of the AWS SDK for .NET\nThe following C# code example downloads an archive from the speci\ufb01ed vault.", "After the job \ncompletes, the example downloads the entire output in a single GetJobOutput  call.", "For an \nexample of downloading output in chunks, see Example 2: Retrieving an Archive Using the Low-\nLevel API of the AWS SDK for .NET\u2014Download Output in Chunks.\nThe example performs the following tasks:\n\u2022Sets up an Amazon Simple Noti\ufb01cation Service (Amazon SNS) topic\nS3 Glacier sends a noti\ufb01cation to this topic after it completes the job.\n\u2022Sets up an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.\nThe example attaches a policy to the queue to enable the Amazon SNS topic to post messages.\n\u2022Initiates a job to download the speci\ufb01ed archive.\nDownloading an Archive Using .NET API Version 2012-06-01 164Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nIn the job request, the example speci\ufb01es the Amazon SNS topic so that S3 Glacier can send a \nmessage after it completes the job.\n\u2022Periodically checks the Amazon SQS queue for a message.\nIf there is a message, parse the JSON and check if the job completed successfully.", "If it did, \ndownload the archive.", "The code example uses the JSON.NET library (see JSON.NET) to parse the \nJSON.\n\u2022Cleans up by deleting the Amazon SNS topic and the Amazon SQS queue it created.\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing Amazon.Glacier;\nusing Amazon.Glacier.Model;\nusing Amazon.Runtime;\nusing Amazon.SimpleNotificationService;\nusing Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.Model;\nusing Amazon.SQS;\nusing Amazon.SQS.Model;\nusing Newtonsoft.Json;\nnamespace glacier.amazon.com.docsamples\n{ \n  class ArchiveDownloadLowLevelUsingSNSSQS \n  { \n    static string topicArn; \n    static string queueUrl; \n    static string queueArn; \n    static string vaultName = \"*** Provide vault name ***\"; \n    static string archiveID = \"*** Provide archive ID ***\"; \n    static string fileName  = \"*** Provide the file name and path to where to store \n downloaded archive ***\"; \n    static AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient snsClient; \n    static AmazonSQSClient sqsClient; \n    const string SQS_POLICY = \n        \"{\" + \n        \"    \\\"Version\\\" : \\\"2012-10-17\\\",\" + \n        \"    \\\"Statement\\\" : [\" + \n        \"        {\" + \nDownloading an Archive Using .NET API Version 2012-06-01 165Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\n        \"            \\\"Sid\\\" : \\\"sns-rule\\\",\" + \n        \"            \\\"Effect\\\" : \\\"Allow\\\",\" + \n        \"            \\\"Principal\\\" : {\\\"Service\\\" : \\\"sns.amazonaws.com\\\" },\" + \n        \"            \\\"Action\\\"    : \\\"sqs:SendMessage\\\",\" + \n        \"            \\\"Resource\\\"  : \\\"{QueueArn}\\\",\" + \n        \"            \\\"Condition\\\" : {\" + \n        \"                \\\"ArnLike\\\" : {\" + \n        \"                    \\\"aws:SourceArn\\\" : \\\"{TopicArn}\\\"\" + \n        \"                }\" + \n        \"            }\" + \n        \"        }\" + \n        \"    ]\" + \n        \"}\"; \n    public static void Main(string[] args) \n    { \n      AmazonGlacierClient client; \n      try \n      { \n        using (client = new AmazonGlacierClient(Amazon.RegionEndpoint.USWest2)) \n        { \n          Console.WriteLine(\"Setup SNS topic and SQS queue.\");  \n          SetupTopicAndQueue(); \n          Console.WriteLine(\"To continue, press Enter\"); Console.ReadKey(); \n          Console.WriteLine(\"Retrieving...\"); \n          RetrieveArchive(client); \n        } \n        Console.WriteLine(\"Operations successful.

The SDK libraries wrap \nthe underlying S3 Glacier API, simplifying your programming tasks. For example, for each request \nsent to S3 Glacier, you must include a signature to authenticate your requests. When you use the \nSDK libraries, you need to provide only your AWS security credentials in your code and the libraries \ncompute the necessary signature and include it in the request sent to S3 Glacier.

AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) users, your company's single sign-on \nauthentication, and your Google or Facebook credentials are examples of federated identities. \nWhen you sign in as a federated identity, your administrator previously set up identity federation \nusing IAM roles. When you access AWS by using federation, you are indirectly assuming a role.\nDepending on the type of user you are, you can sign in to the AWS Management Console or the \nAWS access portal. For more information about signing in to AWS, see How to sign in to your AWS \naccount in the AWS Sign-In User Guide.\nIf you access AWS programmatically, AWS provides a software development kit (SDK) and a \ncommand line interface (CLI) to cryptographically sign your requests by using your credentials. If \nyou don't use AWS tools, you must sign requests yourself. For more information about using the \nrecommended method to sign requests yourself, see AWS Signature Version 4 for API requests in \nthe IAM User Guide .\nRegardless of the authentication method that you use, you might be required to provide additional \nsecurity information. For example, AWS recommends that you use multi-factor authentication \n(MFA) to increase the security of your account. To learn more, see Multi-factor authentication in \nthe AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide and AWS Multi-factor authentication in IAM in the IAM User \nGuide .\nAWS account root user\nWhen you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to \nall AWS services and resources in the account.

When federated identities access AWS accounts, \nthey assume roles, and the roles provide temporary credentials.\nFor centralized access management, we recommend that you use AWS IAM Identity Center. You can \ncreate users and groups in IAM Identity Center, or you can connect and synchronize to a set of users \nand groups in your own identity source for use across all your AWS accounts and applications. For \ninformation about IAM Identity Center, see What is IAM Identity Center? in the AWS IAM Identity \nCenter User Guide .\nIAM users and groups\nAn IAM user  is an identity within your AWS account that has speci\ufb01c permissions for a single person \nor application. Where possible, we recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating \nIAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. However, if you have \nspeci\ufb01c use cases that require long-term credentials with IAM users, we recommend that you rotate \naccess keys. For more information, see Rotate access keys regularly for use cases that require long-\nterm credentials in the IAM User Guide .\nAn IAM group  is an identity that speci\ufb01es a collection of IAM users.", "You can't sign in as a group. You \ncan use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier \nto manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMAdmins  and give \nthat group permissions to administer IAM resources.\nUsers are di\ufb00erent from roles.

Service-linked \nroles appear in your AWS account and are owned by the service. An IAM administrator can \nview, but not edit the permissions for service-linked roles.\n\u2022Applications running on Amazon EC2 \u2013 You can use an IAM role to manage temporary \ncredentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API \nrequests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role \nto an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance pro\ufb01le \nthat is attached to the instance. An instance pro\ufb01le contains the role and enables programs that \nare running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using \nan IAM role to grant permissions to applications running on Amazon EC2 instances in the IAM \nUser Guide .\nManaging access using policies\nYou control access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to AWS identities or resources. \nA policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, de\ufb01nes their \npermissions. AWS evaluates these policies when a principal (user, root user, or role session) makes \na request.", "Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied.", "Most \npolicies are stored in AWS as JSON documents.

If you want to retrieve more data than is in your \nAWS Free Tier allowance, you can use a Max Retrieval Rate policy to set a bytes-per-hour retrieval-\nrate quota. The Max Retrieval Rate policy ensures that the peak retrieval rate from all retrieval jobs \nacross your account in an AWS Region does not exceed the bytes-per-hour quota that you set.\nWith both the Free Tier Only and Max Retrieval Rate policies, data retrieval requests that exceed \nthe retrieval quotas that you speci\ufb01ed are not accepted.", "If you use a Free Tier Only policy, S3 \nGlacier synchronously rejects retrieval requests that exceed your AWS Free Tier allowance. If you \nChoosing an S3 Glacier Data Retrieval Policy API Version 2012-06-01 323Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nuse a Max Retrieval Rate policy, S3 Glacier rejects retrieval requests that cause the peak retrieval \nrate of the in-progress jobs to exceed the bytes-per-hour quota set by the policy. These policies \nhelp you simplify data retrieval cost management.\nThe following are some useful facts about data retrieval policies:\n\u2022Data retrieval policy settings do not change the 3- to 5-hour period that it takes to retrieve data \nfrom S3 Glacier by using Standard retrievals.\n\u2022Setting a new data retrieval policy does not a\ufb00ect previously accepted retrieval jobs that are \nalready in progress.\n\u2022If a retrieval job request is rejected because of a data retrieval policy, you are not charged for the \njob or the request.\n\u2022You can set one data retrieval policy for each AWS Region, which will govern all data retrieval \nactivities in the AWS Region under your account. A data retrieval policy is speci\ufb01c to a particular \nAWS Region because data retrieval costs vary across AWS Regions.", "For more information, see\nAmazon S3 Glacier pricing.\nFree Tier Only Policy\nYou can set a data retrieval policy to Free Tier Only to ensure that your retrievals always stay within \nyour AWS Free Tier allowance, so that you don't incur data retrieval charges.", "If a retrieval request is \nrejected, you receive an error message stating that the request has been denied by the current data \nretrieval policy.\nYou can set the data retrieval policy to Free Tier Only on a per-Region basis. After the policy is set, \nyou cannot retrieve more data in a day than your prorated daily AWS Free Tier retrieval allowance \nfor that AWS Region. You also do not incur data retrieval fees.\nYou can also switch to a Free Tier Only policy after you have incurred data retrieval charges within \na month. In that case, the Free Tier Only policy takes e\ufb00ect for new retrieval requests, but does not \na\ufb00ect past requests.", "You will be billed for the previously incurred charges.\nMax Retrieval Rate Policy\nYou can set your data retrieval policy to Max Retrieval Rate to control the peak retrieval rate by \nspecifying a data retrieval quota that has a bytes-per-hour maximum. When you set the data \nretrieval policy to Max Retrieval Rate, a new retrieval request is rejected if it would cause the peak \nFree Tier Only Policy API Version 2012-06-01 324Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nretrieval rate of the in-progress jobs to exceed the bytes-per-hour quota that's speci\ufb01ed by the \npolicy. If a retrieval job request is rejected, you receive an error message stating that the request \nhas been denied by the current data retrieval policy.\nSetting your data retrieval policy to the Max Retrieval Rate policy can a\ufb00ect how much of your \nAWS Free Tier allowance that you can use in a day. For example, suppose you set Max Retrieval Rate \nto 1 MB per hour.", "This is less than the AWS Free Tier policy rate. To ensure that you make good use \nof the daily AWS Free Tier allowance, you can \ufb01rst set your policy to Free Tier Only, and then switch \nto the Max Retrieval Rate policy later if you need to.", "For more information about how your retrieval \nallowance is calculated, go to Amazon S3 Glacier FAQs.\nNo Retrieval Limit Policy\nIf your data retrieval policy is set to No Retrieval Limit, all valid data retrieval requests are accepted \nand your data retrieval costs will vary based on your usage.\nUsing the S3 Glacier Console to Set Up a Data Retrieval Policy\nTo create a data retrieval policy by using the Amazon S3 Glacier console\n1.

If both of these \nranges are tree-hash aligned, then you will receive checksum data when you download the data.\nA range [ A, B] is tree-hash aligned  with respect to an archive if and only if when a new tree hash \nis built over [A, B], the root of the tree hash of that range is equivalent to a node in the tree hash \nof the whole archive. You can see this shown in the diagram in Tree Hash Example: Retrieving an \narchive range that is tree-hash aligned. In this section, we provide the speci\ufb01cation for tree-hash \nalignment.\nConsider [ P, Q) as the range query for an archive of N megabytes (MB) and P and Q are multiples of \none MB.

You can also upload these parts in parallel.", "You can upload up to \n10,000 parts for a multipart upload.\nFor information about multipart upload, see Uploading Large Archives in Parts (Multipart Upload).\nAmazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is \ntrue:\n\u2022SHA256 tree hash does not match\u2014 To ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, \nyou compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the \npart data, S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If the two hash values don't match, \nUpload Part API Version 2012-06-01 461Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nthe operation fails.", "For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing \nChecksums .\n\u2022SHA256 linear hash does not match\u2014 Required for authorization, you compute a SHA256 \nlinear hash of the entire uploaded payload and include it in your request. For information about \ncomputing a SHA256 linear hash, see Computing Checksums .\n\u2022Part size does not match\u2014The size of each part except the last must match the size that is \nspeci\ufb01ed in the corresponding Initiate Multipart Upload (POST multipart-uploads) request. The \nsize of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the speci\ufb01ed size.\nNote\nIf you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you speci\ufb01ed in your initiate \nmultipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request \nwill succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.\n\u2022Range does not align\u2014 The byte range value in the request does not align with the part size \nspeci\ufb01ed in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 \nbytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB \u20141) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB \u20141) \nare valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align \nwith the part size and the upload will fail.\nThis operation is idempotent. If you upload the same part multiple times, the data included in the \nmost recent request overwrites the previously uploaded data.\nRequests\nYou send this HTTP PUT request to the URI of the upload ID that was returned by your Initiate \nMultipart Upload request.", "S3 Glacier uses the upload ID to associate part uploads with a speci\ufb01c \nmultipart upload.", "The request must include a SHA256 tree hash of the part data (x-amz-SHA256-\ntree-hash  header), a SHA256 linear hash of the entire payload (x-amz-content-sha256\nheader), the byte range (Content-Range  header), and the length of the part in bytes (Content-\nLength  header).\nSyntax\nPUT /AccountId /vaults/ VaultName /multipart-uploads/ uploadID  HTTP/1.1\nHost: glacier.
