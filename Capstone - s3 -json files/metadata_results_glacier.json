Guide\nThis page is only for existing customers of the S3 Glacier service using Vaults and the original \nREST API from 2012.\nIf you're looking for archival storage solutions we suggest using the S3 Glacier storage classes \nin Amazon S3, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, and S3 Glacier Deep \nArchive. To learn more about these storage options, see S3 Glacier storage classes  and Long-term \ndata storage using S3 Glacier storage classes  in the Amazon S3 User Guide . These storage classes \nuse the Amazon S3 API, are available in all regions, and can be managed within the Amazon S3 \nconsole. They o\ufb00er features like Storage Cost Analysis, Storage Lens, advanced optional encryption \nfeatures, and more.\nAPI Version 2012-06-01 xAmazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nWhat Is Amazon S3 Glacier?\nIf you're currently using the Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) service and want to learn more, you'll \n\ufb01nd the information that you need in this guide.

You can deploy \na variety of compliance controls in a Vault Lock policy by using the AWS Identity and Access \nManagement (IAM) policy language. For more information about Vault Lock policies, see Vault Lock \nPolicies.\nA Vault Lock policy is di\ufb00erent from a vault access policy. Both policies govern access controls to \nyour vault. However, a Vault Lock policy can be locked to prevent future changes, which provides \nstrong enforcement for your compliance controls. You can use the Vault Lock policy to deploy \nregulatory and compliance controls, which typically require tight controls on data access.\nImportant\nWe recommend that you \ufb01rst create a vault, complete a Vault Lock policy, and then upload \nyour archives to the vault so that the policy will be applied to them.\nVault Lock API Version 2012-06-01 99Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nIn contrast, you use a vault access policy to implement access controls that are not compliance \nrelated, temporary, and subject to frequent modi\ufb01cation. You can use Vault lock and vault access \npolicies together. For example, you can implement time-based data-retention rules in the Vault \nLock policy (deny deletes), and grant read access to designated third parties or your business \npartners (allow reads) in your vault access policy.\nLocking a vault takes two steps:\n1.Initiate the lock by attaching a Vault Lock policy to your vault, which sets the lock to an in-\nprogress state and returns a lock ID. While the policy is in the in-progress state, you have 24 \nhours to validate your Vault Lock policy before the lock ID expires. To prevent your vault from \nexiting the in-progress state, you must complete the Vault Lock process within these 24 hours. \nOtherwise, your Vault Lock policy will be deleted.\n2.Use the lock ID to complete the lock process.

If it did, \ndownload the archive.\n\u2022Cleans up by deleting the Amazon SNS topic and the Amazon SQS queue that it created.\nDownloading an Archive Using Java API Version 2012-06-01 147Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nimport java.io.BufferedInputStream;\nimport java.io.BufferedOutputStream;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.BufferedWriter;\nimport java.io.FileOutputStream;\nimport java.io.FileWriter;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.io.OutputStream;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonFactory;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonNode;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonParseException;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.JsonParser;\nimport org.codehaus.jackson.map.ObjectMapper;\nimport com.amazonaws.AmazonClientException;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.Policy;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.Principal;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.Resource;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.Statement;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.Statement.Effect;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.policy.actions.SQSActions;\nimport com.amazonaws.auth.profile.ProfileCredentialsProvider;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.AmazonGlacierClient;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.GetJobOutputRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.GetJobOutputResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.InitiateJobRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.InitiateJobResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.glacier.model.JobParameters;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.AmazonSNSClient;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.CreateTopicRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.CreateTopicResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.DeleteTopicRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.SubscribeRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.SubscribeResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sns.model.UnsubscribeRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.AmazonSQSClient;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.CreateQueueRequest;\nDownloading an Archive Using Java API Version 2012-06-01 148Amazon S3 Glacier Developer Guide\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.CreateQueueResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.DeleteQueueRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.GetQueueAttributesRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.GetQueueAttributesResult;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.Message;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.ReceiveMessageRequest;\nimport com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.SetQueueAttributesRequest;\npublic class AmazonGlacierDownloadArchiveWithSQSPolling { \n     \n    public static String archiveId = \"*** provide archive ID ****\";

Accordingly, you must include \nthe tree hash of the entire archive in the x-amz-sha256-tree-hash  request header. Suppose \nyou want to upload a 6.5 MB archive. The following diagram illustrates the process of creating \nthe SHA-256 hash of the archive. You read the archive and compute the SHA-256 hash for each \n1 MB chunk.",
