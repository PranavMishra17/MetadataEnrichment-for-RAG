For more information about access point aliases, see Using a bucket-style alias for your S3 on \nOutposts bucket access point.\nAccess points have distinct permissions and network controls that S3 on Outposts applies for any \nrequest that is made through that access point. Each access point enforces a customized access \npoint policy that works in conjunction with the bucket policy that is attached to the underlying \nbucket.\nFor more information, see Accessing your S3 on Outposts buckets and objects.\nFeatures of S3 on Outposts\nAccess management\nS3 on Outposts provides features for auditing and managing access to your buckets and objects.

The \nnext section describes how to make requests over IPv6 by using dual-stack endpoints.\nThe following are important considerations before trying to access an S3 on Outposts bucket over \nIPv6:\n\u2022The client and the network accessing the bucket must be enabled to use IPv6.\n\u2022Both virtual hosted-style and path style requests are supported for IPv6 access. For more \ninformation, see Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints .\n\u2022If you use source IP address \ufb01ltering in your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or \nS3 on Outposts bucket policies, you must update the policies to include IPv6 address ranges.\nNote\nThis requirement only applies to S3 on Outposts bucket operations and control plane \nresources across IPv6 networks. Amazon S3 on Outposts object actions aren\u2019t supported \nacross IPv6 networks.\n\u2022When using IPv6, server access log \ufb01les output IP addresses in an IPv6 format. You must update \nexisting tools, scripts, and software that you use to parse S3 on Outposts log \ufb01les, so that they \ncan parse the IPv6 formatted remote IP addresses. The updated tools, scripts, and software will \nthen correctly parse the IPv6 formatted remote IP addresses.\nGetting started with IPv6 API Version 2006-03-01 200Amazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\nUsing dual-stack endpoints to make requests over an IPv6 network\nTo make requests with S3 on Outposts API calls over IPv6, you can use dual-stack endpoints \nvia AWS CLI or AWS SDK. The Amazon S3 control API operations  and S3 on Outposts API \noperations  work the same way whether you\u2019re accessing S3 on Outposts over an IPv6 protocol \nor IPv4 protocol. However, be aware that S3 on Outposts object actions (such as PutObject  or\nGetObject ) aren\u2019t supported over IPv6 networks.\nWhen using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and AWS SDKs, you can use a parameter \nor \ufb02ag to change to a dual-stack endpoint. You can also specify the dual-stack endpoint directly as \nan override of the S3 on Outposts endpoint in the con\ufb01guration \ufb01le.\nYou can use a dual-stack endpoint to access an S3 on Outposts bucket over IPv6 from any of the \nfollowing:\n\u2022The AWS CLI, see Using dual-stack endpoints from the AWS CLI.\n\u2022The AWS SDKs, see Using S3 on Outposts dual-stack endpoints from the AWS SDKs.\nUsing IPv6 addresses in IAM policies\nBefore trying to access an S3 on Outposts bucket using an IPv6 protocol, make sure that IAM users \nor S3 on Outposts bucket policies used for IP address \ufb01ltering are updated to include IPv6 address \nranges. If IP address \ufb01ltering policies aren\u2019t updated to handle IPv6 addresses, you can lose access \nto an S3 on Outposts bucket while trying to use the IPv6 protocol.\nIAM policies that \ufb01lter IP addresses use IP address condition operators. The following S3 on \nOutposts bucket policy identi\ufb01es the 54.240.143.* IP range of allowed IPv4 addresses by using IP \naddress condition operators. Any IP addresses outside of this range will be denied access to the S3 \non Outposts bucket (DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET ). Since all IPv6 addresses are outside of the allowed \nrange, this policy prevents IPv6 addresses from being able to access DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET .\n{ \n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \n  \"Statement\": [ \n    { \n      \"Sid\": \"IPAllow\", \n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \n      \"Principal\": \"*\", \nMaking requests using dual-stack endpoints API Version 2006-03-01 201Amazon S3 on Outposts User Guide\n      \"Action\": \"s3outposts:*\", \n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3-outposts: region:111122223333 :outpost/ OUTPOSTS-ID /\nbucket/DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET /*\", \n      \"Condition\": { \n         \"IpAddress\": {\"aws:SourceIp\": \"54.240.143.0/24\"} \n      }  \n    }  \n  ]\n}\nYou can modify the S3 on Outposts bucket policy's Condition  element to allow both IPv4 \n(54.240.143.0/24 ) and IPv6 ( 2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64 ) address ranges as shown in the \nfollowing example. You can use the same type of Condition  block shown in the example to \nupdate both your IAM user and bucket policies.\n       \"Condition\": { \n         \"IpAddress\": { \n            \"aws:SourceIp\": [ \n              \"54.240.143.0/24\", \n               \"2001:DB8:1234:5678::/64\" \n             ] \n          } \n        }\nBefore using IPv6 you must update all relevant IAM user and bucket policies that use IP address \n\ufb01ltering to allow IPv6 address ranges. We recommend that you update your IAM policies with your \norganization's IPv6 address ranges in addition to your existing IPv4 address ranges. For an example \nof a bucket policy that allows access over both IPv6 and IPv4, see Restrict access to speci\ufb01c IP \naddresses.\nYou can review your IAM user policies using the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ \niam/ .",
