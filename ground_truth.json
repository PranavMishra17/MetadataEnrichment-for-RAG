        "question": "How does S3 on Outposts differ from standard Amazon S3, and what are the key considerations for its use in hybrid cloud environments?",
        "answer": "S3 on Outposts extends S3 to on-premises environments, providing the same APIs and features as the cloud-based S3 but within Outposts hardware. It differs from standard S3 by being located on-premises, supporting local data residency requirements, and integrating with on-premises networks. Key considerations include network connectivity, cost implications, and ensuring that AWS services available in the Outpost region are compatible with S3 on Outposts."

        "question": "Debug the following issue: An S3 on Outposts bucket policy returns an `Access Denied` error for cross-account operations. What might be missing in the policy, and how can it be fixed?",
        "answer": "The bucket policy might lack a statement granting cross-account access. Ensure the policy includes `Principal` set to the account ID of the external user and the required permissions, such as `s3:PutObject` or `s3:GetObject`. Additionally, verify that the IAM role or user in the other account has corresponding permissions to access the bucket on Outposts."

Ensure the endpoint's security group allows inbound and outbound traffic for the necessary ports.\n3. Confirm the route tables in the VPC direct traffic for the S3 prefix list to the PrivateLink endpoint.\n4. Check bucket permissions and ensure they allow access from the source account or principal.\n5. Validate DNS settings to resolve the S3 endpoint correctly."
