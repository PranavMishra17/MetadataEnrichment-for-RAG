    "question": "Debug the following issue: An S3 on Outposts bucket policy returns an `Access Denied` error for cross-account operations. What might be missing in the policy, and how can it be fixed?",
    "answer": "The `Access Denied` error for cross-account operations on an S3 on Outposts bucket policy is likely due to missing permissions related to AWS Key Management Service (KMS) when using server-side encryption (SSE-KMS). Here's a detailed explanation based on the provided context:\n\n### **Possible Missing Element: KMS Key Permissions**\n\nWhen performing cross-account operations on an S3 bucket that uses SSE-KMS for encryption, it's essential to ensure that both the bucket policy **and** the KMS key policy permit the necessary access. The context provided highlights the following points:\n\n- **KMS Key ARN Requirement:** To use a KMS key owned by a different account, you must enter the KMS key Amazon Resource Name (ARN).\n  \n- **Cross-Account Permissions:** You must first have permission to use the KMS key, which involves configuring the KMS key policy to allow access from the external account.\n\n- **Symmetric Encryption KMS Keys:** Amazon S3 supports only symmetric encryption KMS keys for SSE-KMS. Ensure that the KMS key in use is symmetric.\n\n### **Steps to Fix the Issue:**\n\n1. **Verify the Bucket Policy:**\n   - Ensure that the bucket policy explicitly grants the necessary S3 permissions (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`) to the external account attempting the access.\n   - Example snippet for bucket policy:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\n         {\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n           \"Principal\": {\n             \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ID:root\"\n           },\n           \"Action\": [\n             \"s3:GetObject\",\n             \"s3:PutObject\"\n           ],\n           \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3-outposts:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:outpost/OUTPOST_ID/bucket/BUCKET_NAME/*\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Update the KMS Key Policy:**\n   - The KMS key policy must allow the external account to use the key for encryption and decryption.\n   - Include permissions such as `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:ReEncrypt*`, `kms:GenerateDataKey*`, and `kms:DescribeKey` for the external account.\n   - Example snippet for KMS key policy:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\n         {\n           \"Sid\": \"Allow use of the key\",\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n           \"Principal\": {\n             \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::EXTERNAL_ACCOUNT_ID:root\"\n           },\n           \"Action\": [\n             \"kms:Encrypt\",\n             \"kms:Decrypt\",\n             \"kms:ReEncrypt*\",\n             \"kms:GenerateDataKey*\",\n             \"kms:DescribeKey\"\n           ],\n           \"Resource\": \"*\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Specify the KMS Key ARN in the Bucket Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the bucket is configured to use the correct KMS key ARN that the external account has permissions for.\n   - This involves setting the `SSE-KMS` configuration in the bucket to reference the appropriate KMS key.\n\n4. **Enable S3 Bucket Keys (Optional for Cost Reduction):**\n   - If you have configured default encryption with SSE-KMS, consider enabling S3 Bucket Keys to reduce the cost of encryption by decreasing request traffic from Amazon S3 to AWS KMS.\n   - This can be done by choosing **Enable** under **Bucket Key** in the bucket's encryption settings.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe `Access Denied` error is likely due to insufficient permissions in the KMS key policy for the external account. To resolve this:\n\n- **Ensure the bucket policy grants the necessary S3 permissions to the external account.**\n- **Update the KMS key policy to allow the external account to use the key for encryption and decryption.**\n- **Verify that the bucket is correctly configured to use the specified KMS key ARN.**\n\nBy addressing both the bucket policy and the KMS key policy, cross-account operations should function without encountering `Access Denied` errors.",

You can send requests to Amazon S3 using the AWS SDK libraries, which wrap \nthe underlying Amazon S3 REST API and simplify your programming tasks. For example, the SDKs \ntake care of tasks such as calculating signatures, cryptographically signing requests, managing \nerrors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to \ndownload and install them, see Tools for AWS.\nEvery interaction with Amazon S3 is either authenticated or anonymous. If you are using the AWS \nSDKs, the libraries compute the signature for authentication from the keys that you provide. For \nmore information about how to make requests to Amazon S3, see Making requests .\nAmazon S3 REST API\nThe architecture of Amazon S3 is designed to be programming language-neutral, using AWS-\nsupported interfaces to store and retrieve objects. You can access S3 and AWS programmatically \nby using the Amazon S3 REST API. The REST API is an HTTP interface to Amazon S3. With the REST \nAPI, you use standard HTTP requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.\nTo use the REST API, you can use any toolkit that supports HTTP. You can even use a browser to \nfetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable.\nThe REST API uses standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard browsers and \ntoolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality to HTTP (for example, we \nadded headers to support access control). In these cases, we have done our best to add the new \nfunctionality in a way that matches the style of standard HTTP usage.\nIf you make direct REST API calls in your application, you must write the code to compute the \nsignature and add it to the request. For more information about how to make requests to Amazon \nS3, see Making requests  in the Amazon S3 API Reference.\nNote\nSOAP API support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over HTTPS. Newer \nAmazon S3 features are not supported for SOAP. We recommend that you use either the \nREST API or the AWS SDKs.\nAmazon S3 REST API API Version 2006-03-01 14",

    "question": "Explain how to integrate S3 on Outposts with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.",
    "answer": "To integrate **Amazon S3 on Outposts** with **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for fine-grained access control, you can leverage a combination of IAM policies, S3 on Outposts access points, and bucket policies. Here\u2019s a detailed approach based solely on the provided context:\n\n### 1. **Utilize AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**\n\n**IAM** is a foundational service that enables you to securely control access to AWS resources, including your S3 on Outposts resources. With IAM, you can centrally manage permissions, determining who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use your S3 on Outposts resources.\n\n- **Manage Permissions Centrally:** Use IAM to create and manage permissions that define which IAM users, groups, or roles can access specific S3 on Outposts resources.\n- **Authentication and Authorization:** Control who can sign in and what actions they can perform on your S3 on Outposts buckets and objects.\n\n### 2. **Leverage S3 on Outposts Access Points**\n\n**S3 on Outposts access points** provide a mechanism to manage data access for shared datasets with fine-grained control. Each access point is a named network endpoint with its own dedicated access policy.\n\n- **Dedicated Access Policies:** Assign specific access policies to each access point, allowing you to define precise permissions for different use cases or user groups.\n- **Attach to Buckets:** Access points are attached to specific S3 on Outposts buckets, enabling you to perform object operations such as `GetObject` and `PutObject` based on the policies defined.\n- **Network Endpoint Management:** By using access points, you can control how different applications or services access the data within your S3 on Outposts buckets.\n\n### 3. **Implement Bucket Policies for Resource-Based Permissions**\n\n**Bucket policies** allow you to define resource-based permissions using IAM-based policy language. These policies are attached directly to S3 buckets and the objects within them.\n\n- **Granular Permissions:** Configure bucket policies to specify who can access the bucket and what actions they can perform on the objects.\n- **Combine with IAM Policies:** Bucket policies can be used in conjunction with IAM policies to enforce comprehensive access control strategies.\n- **Example Use Cases:** Grant specific AWS accounts or IAM users permissions to perform actions like `PUT Object`, enabling other accounts to upload objects to your bucket.\n\n### 4. **Combine IAM Policies, Access Points, and Bucket Policies for Fine-Grained Control**\n\nFor the most granular access control, integrate IAM policies, S3 on Outposts access points, and bucket policies:\n\n- **IAM Policies:** Define what authenticated users, groups, or roles can do across AWS resources, including S3 on Outposts.\n- **Access Point Policies:** Specify detailed permissions for specific access points attached to your S3 on Outposts buckets, tailored to different applications or user groups.\n- **Bucket Policies:** Ensure that resource-based permissions are in place to control access directly at the bucket and object level.\n\n### 5. **Ensure Policy Validation and Best Practices**\n\nWhen creating or editing access policies:\n\n- **Use IAM Access Analyzer:** Before saving your policies, utilize IAM Access Analyzer to validate your policies against IAM policy grammar and best practices. This helps identify and resolve security warnings, errors, and suggestions.\n- **Follow Security Best Practices:** Properly apply access management tools to ensure that your S3 on Outposts resources are accessible only to intended users, maintaining the security and integrity of your data.\n\n### Summary\n\nBy integrating **S3 on Outposts** with **IAM**, and utilizing **access points** and **bucket policies**, you can achieve fine-grained access control tailored to your organizational needs. This approach ensures that only authenticated and authorized users have the necessary permissions to interact with your S3 on Outposts resources, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.",

    "question": "What are the different types of retrieval options available in S3 Glacier, and when should each be used?",
    "answer": "The Amazon S3 Glacier service offers different retrieval options tailored to various access needs and cost considerations. Based on the provided context, the primary retrieval options available in S3 Glacier are **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** and **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**. Here's a detailed overview of each:\n\n### 1. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval\n\n**Description:**\n- **Real-Time Access:** Provides millisecond retrieval times, allowing immediate access to archived objects.\n- **Access Frequency:** Ideal for data accessed approximately once per quarter.\n- **Performance:** Matches the latency and throughput performance of the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) storage class.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- **Performance-Sensitive Applications:** Suitable for applications that require quick access to archived data, such as:\n  - **Image Hosting:** Fast retrieval of images when needed.\n  - **File-Sharing Applications:** Instant access to shared files without delay.\n  - **Medical Records Access:** Quick access to medical records during patient appointments.\n\n**Cost Considerations:**\n- **Storage Costs:** Lower compared to S3 Standard-IA.\n- **Data Access Costs:** Higher due to the provision of real-time access.\n\n**Additional Specifications:**\n- **Minimum Object Size:** 128 KB. Objects smaller than this size incur additional storage overhead.\n- **Minimum Storage Duration:** 90 days. Objects must be stored for at least this duration to avoid early deletion fees.\n\n### 2. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\n\n**Description:**\n- **Archived Storage:** Objects are archived and not available for real-time access. To retrieve data, a restore request must be initiated, creating a temporary copy of the object.\n- **Flexible Retrieval Times:** Offers retrieval times ranging from a few minutes to several hours, allowing users to balance cost and access speed based on their needs.\n- **Bulk Retrievals:** Provides free bulk retrievals, which can be beneficial for large-scale data restoration tasks.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Suitable for storing backup data that is infrequently accessed but must be retained for compliance or recovery purposes.\n- **Archive Data:** Ideal for data accessed one to two times a year, where immediate access is not critical.\n\n**Cost Considerations:**\n- **Storage Costs:** Lower than standard storage classes due to less frequent access.\n- **Retrieval Costs:** More cost-effective when opting for longer retrieval times, as different retrieval tiers offer varying cost structures based on access speed.\n\n**Additional Specifications:**\n- **Restore Process:** Users must initiate a restore request to access archived objects. The temporary copy remains accessible for a specified duration after restoration.\n- **Retrieval Tiers:** Users can choose from different retrieval tiers to meet specific use cases, balancing cost against retrieval speed.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** is best suited for data that requires immediate access with high performance but is not frequently accessed. Its lower storage costs make it cost-effective for performance-sensitive applications that need quick access when required.\n\n- **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** is ideal for data that is accessed infrequently and does not require immediate access. It offers flexibility in retrieval times and cost, making it suitable for backup and disaster recovery scenarios where data needs to be retained over long periods with occasional access.\n\nBy selecting the appropriate retrieval option based on access patterns and performance requirements, users can optimize both cost and efficiency for their data storage needs in Amazon S3 Glacier.",

    "question": "How can an organization optimize data retrieval costs for large datasets stored in S3 Glacier?",
    "answer": "An organization can optimize data retrieval costs for large datasets stored in Amazon S3 Glacier by leveraging the **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** storage class. Here are the specific strategies based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Choose S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval:**\n   - **Access Patterns:** This storage class is ideal for archive data that is accessed **one to two times a year**. By selecting a storage class that aligns with the actual access frequency, the organization ensures that they are not overpaying for higher-access storage options.\n   - **Non-Immediate Access Requirements:** Since the data does not require immediate access, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval allows for cost savings by accommodating longer retrieval times.\n\n2. **Utilize Flexible Retrieval Tiers:**\n   - **Balance Costs and Retrieval Times:** S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval offers various retrieval tiers that range from **a few minutes to hours**. By selecting a retrieval tier that matches the organization's tolerance for retrieval latency, costs can be minimized. For example, opting for a retrieval tier with longer restore times typically incurs lower costs.\n   - **Free Bulk Retrievals:** Taking advantage of free bulk retrievals can significantly reduce costs, especially when handling large volumes of data. Bulk retrievals are suitable for scenarios where data access is planned and can be scheduled in advance.\n\n3. **Initiate Restore Requests Wisely:**\n   - **Temporary Copies for Access:** To access archived objects, initiate a restore request that creates a temporary copy of the object. Planning these restore requests efficiently ensures that only necessary data is temporarily accessed, thereby controlling costs associated with data retrieval.\n\n4. **Optimize Storage and Retrieval Settings:**\n   - **Minimum Storage Duration:** Be aware of the minimum storage duration period (e.g., 90 days for certain storage classes) to avoid additional charges. Ensuring that data remains archived beyond the minimum duration can help in optimizing storage costs.\n   - **Minimum Object Size:** Understand the minimum object size requirements (e.g., 128 KB for S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval) to ensure that storage configurations are cost-effective and suited to the dataset's characteristics.\n\n5. **Leverage Cost-Effective Practices:**\n   - **Bulk Operations:** Where possible, perform bulk operations to take advantage of cost efficiencies.\n   - **Automate Processes:** Use tools like AWS CloudFormation templates or the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) to automate the setup and management of Object Lambda Access Points, ensuring best practices are followed and reducing the risk of manual errors that could lead to increased costs.\n\nBy carefully selecting the **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** storage class, leveraging flexible retrieval tiers, and optimizing access patterns and configurations, an organization can significantly reduce data retrieval costs for large datasets stored in Amazon S3 Glacier.",

        "content": "Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide\nSome S3 Glacier storage classes are archival, which means the objects stored in those classes are \narchived and not available for real-time access. For more information, see Understanding archival \nstorage in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Glacier Deep Archive.\nStorage classes designed for less frequent access patterns with longer retrieval times o\ufb00er lower \nstorage costs. For pricing information, see https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/.\nThe following table summarizes the key points to consider when choosing a S3 Glacier storage \nclass:\nS3 Glacier Instant Retrieval\nWe recommend using S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval for long-term data that's accessed once per \nquarter and requires millisecond retrieval times. This storage class is ideal for performance-\nsensitive use cases such as image hosting, \ufb01le-sharing applications, and storing medical records for \naccess during appointments.\nS3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage class o\ufb00ers real-time access to your objects with the same \nlatency and throughput performance as the S3 Standard-IA storage class. When compared to S3 \nStandard-IA, S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval has lower storage costs but higher data access costs.\nThere is a minimum object size of 128 KB for data stored in the S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage \nclass. This storage class also has a minimum storage duration period of 90 days.\nS3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\nWe recommend using S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval for archive data that's accessed one to two times \na year and doesn't require immediate access. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval o\ufb00ers \ufb02exible retrieval \ntimes to help you balance costs, with access times ranging from a few minutes to hours, and free \nbulk retrievals. This storage class is ideal for backup and disaster recovery.\nObjects stored in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval are archived and not available for real-time access. \nFor more information, see Understanding archival storage in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 \nGlacier Deep Archive. To access these objects, you \ufb01rst initiate a restore request which creates a \ntemporary copy of the object that you can access when the request completes. For information, see\nWorking with archived objects. When you restore an object, you can choose a retrieval tier to meet \nyour use case, with lower costs for longer restore times.\nThe following retrieval tiers are available for S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval:\nAmazon S3 Glacier storage classes API Version 2006-03-01 1812",

For more information about managing permissions for your Amazon S3 resources, see\nIdentity and Access Management for Amazon S3.\nManaging public access to buckets\nPublic access is granted to buckets and objects through bucket policies, access control lists (ACLs), \nor both. To help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources, Amazon S3 provides settings \nto block public access. Amazon S3 Block Public Access settings can override ACLs and bucket \npolicies so that you can enforce uniform limits on public access to these resources. You can apply \nBlock Public Access settings to individual buckets or to all buckets in your account.\nTo ensure that all of your Amazon S3 buckets and objects have their public access blocked, all \nfour settings for Block Public Access are enabled by default when you create a new bucket. We \nrecommend that you turn on all four settings for Block Public Access for your account too. These \nsettings block all public access for all current and future buckets.\nBefore applying these settings, verify that your applications will work correctly without public \naccess.

This means \nthat when you store an object in these storage classes that object is archived, and cannot be \naccessed directly. To access an archived object, you submit a restore request for it, and then \nwait for the service to restore the object.

    "question": "How does Amazon S3 handle server-side encryption with KMS keys, and what are the required permissions for using SSE-KMS?",
    "answer": "Amazon S3 handles server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) by allowing you to specify the encryption method and the specific KMS key to be used for encrypting your objects. Here's how it works and the required permissions based on the provided context:\n\n### Handling Server-Side Encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS)\n\n1. **Specify Encryption Algorithm:**\n   - To enable SSE-KMS, you must set the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to `aws:kms` when creating or uploading an object to your S3 bucket.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms\n   ```\n\n2. **Provide KMS Key ID:**\n   - Along with specifying the encryption algorithm, you need to provide the ID of the AWS KMS key that S3 will use to encrypt the object. This is done using the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id` header.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id: <Your-KMS-Key-ID>\n   ```\n\n3. **Optional Encryption Context:**\n   - You can enhance the security of your encrypted objects by providing an encryption context. This is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string containing JSON-formatted key-value pairs that add additional authenticated data to the encryption process. This is specified using the `x-amz-server-side-encryption-context` header.\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context: <Base64-Encoded-JSON>\n   ```\n\n### Required Permissions for Using SSE-KMS\n\nTo use SSE-KMS effectively, certain permissions are required:\n\n1. **S3 Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that the IAM user or role has the necessary permissions to perform S3 operations, such as creating buckets or uploading objects. While the root user can perform these actions, it is recommended to use IAM users with appropriate permissions for security best practices.\n\n2. **KMS Permissions:**\n   - The IAM user or role must have permissions to use the specified KMS key. This typically includes permissions like `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:GenerateDataKey`, and `kms:DescribeKey`.\n   - Additionally, if an encryption context is used, the user must have permissions to use that specific context with the KMS key.\n\n   **Example IAM Policy for KMS:**\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n     \"Statement\": [\n       {\n         \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n         \"Action\": [\n           \"kms:Encrypt\",\n           \"kms:Decrypt\",\n           \"kms:GenerateDataKey\",\n           \"kms:DescribeKey\"\n         ],\n         \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:kms:<region>:<account-id>:key/<key-id>\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Bucket Policies:**\n   - Ensure that the S3 bucket policies allow the use of SSE-KMS and that they reference the correct KMS key. This ensures that only authorized users and services can perform encryption and decryption operations on the objects within the bucket.\n\n### Summary\n\nAmazon S3 utilizes SSE-KMS by requiring you to specify the encryption method (`aws:kms`) and provide the KMS key ID used for encrypting objects. Optionally, you can include an encryption context for added security. To use SSE-KMS, appropriate IAM permissions for both S3 and the specified KMS key are necessary, ensuring that only authorized users can perform encryption and decryption operations on your S3 objects.",

To learn how to set \nup more restrictive policies for the same purpose, see How can I grant public read access to some \nobjects in my Amazon S3 bucket? in the AWS Knowledge Center.\nBy default, Amazon S3 blocks public access to your account and buckets. If you want to use a \nbucket to host a static website, you can use these steps to edit your block public access settings.\nBucket policies API Version 2006-03-01 912",

Categorizing your \nresources is not only useful for organizing them, but you can also set access management rules \nbased on the resource categories. In particular, pre\ufb01xes and tagging are two storage organization \nfeatures that you can use when setting access management permissions.\nNote\nThe following information applies to general purpose buckets. Directory buckets do not \nsupport tagging, and they have pre\ufb01x limitations. For more information, see Authorizing \nRegional endpoint APIs with IAM.\n\u2022Pre\ufb01xes \u2014 A pre\ufb01x in Amazon S3 is a string of characters at the beginning of an object key name \nthat's used to organize the objects that are stored in your S3 buckets. You can use a delimiter \ncharacter, such as a forward slash (/), to indicate the end of the pre\ufb01x within the object key \nname. For example, you might have object key names that start with the engineering/  pre\ufb01x \nor object key names that start with the marketing/campaigns/  pre\ufb01x. Using a delimeter at \nthe end of your pre\ufb01x, such as as a forward slash character / emulates folder and \ufb01le naming \nconventions. However, in S3, the pre\ufb01x is part of the object key name. In general purpose S3 \nbuckets, there is no actual folder hierarchy.\nAmazon S3 supports organizing and grouping objects by using their pre\ufb01xes. You can also \nmanage access to objects by their pre\ufb01xes. For example, you can limit access to only the objects \nwith names that start with a speci\ufb01c pre\ufb01x.\nFor more information, see Organizing objects using pre\ufb01xes. S3 Console uses the concept of\nfolders , which, in general purpose buckets, are essentially pre\ufb01xes that are pre-pended to the \nobject key name. For more information, see Organizing objects in the Amazon S3 console by \nusing folders .\n\u2022Tags \u2014 Each tag is a key-value pair that you assign to resources. For example, you can tag some \nresources with the tag topicCategory=engineering . You can use tagging to help with cost \nallocation, categorizing and organizing, and access control. Bucket tagging is only used for cost \nallocation. You can tag objects, S3 Storage Lens, jobs, and S3 Access Grants for the purposes of \norganizing or for access control. In S3 Access Grants, you can also use tagging for cost-allocation. \nAs an example of controlling access to resources by using their tags, you can share only the \nobjects that have a speci\ufb01c tag or a combination of tags.\nS3 resources API Version 2006-03-01 814",

    "answer": "When you perform a `DeleteObject` API call in a **versioning-enabled** Amazon S3 bucket without specifying a `versionId`, the operation doesn't permanently remove the object. Instead, Amazon S3 **inserts a delete marker**. Here's why this happens based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Versioning Behavior**:\n   - **Versioning-Enabled Bucket**: In a bucket where versioning is enabled, every object version is preserved. Deleting an object without specifying its `versionId` doesn't remove the actual data but rather adds a **delete marker** as the latest version of the object.\n   - **Delete Marker**: A delete marker is a special version of an object that **doesn't contain any content**. Its primary purpose is to indicate that the object has been deleted. When a delete marker is present, it becomes the current version, and the object appears deleted to standard `GET` requests.\n\n2. **Effect of the Delete Marker**:\n   - **Hiding the Null Version**: If the bucket doesn't have a null version (the original version of the object), inserting a delete marker means that the object appears as deleted because the delete marker is the latest version.\n   - **No Content Removal**: Since a delete marker doesn't hold any object data, the underlying content remains intact in previous versions. This ensures that the data isn't lost and can be retrieved by specifying the exact `versionId`.\n\n3. **Permanent Deletion Requirements**:\n   - To **permanently delete** a specific version of an object in a versioning-enabled bucket, you must include the object's `versionId` in the `DeleteObject` request. This action removes that particular version entirely.\n   - Without specifying the `versionId`, the `DeleteObject` call **only adds a delete marker**, leaving all existing versions intact.\n\n4. **Implications**:\n   - **Object Appears Deleted**: For users and applications accessing the bucket without specifying a `versionId`, the object appears deleted because the delete marker is the current version.\n   - **Data Retention**: The actual data remains in the bucket, allowing for recovery or permanent deletion in the future by targeting specific versions.\n\n**Summary**: In a versioning-enabled bucket, a `DeleteObject` API call that doesn't specify a `versionId` succeeds by inserting a delete marker. This marker makes the object appear deleted without removing any actual data, preserving all existing versions for potential future actions.",

    "question": "Guide users through the process of using the `SelectObjectContent` API to query CSV data stored in an S3 bucket.",
    "answer": "To guide users through the process of using the `SelectObjectContent` API to query CSV data stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, follow the steps outlined below based on the provided context.\n\n### **1. Prerequisites**\n\nBefore you begin, ensure the following:\n\n- **Permissions**: You must have the `s3:GetObject` permission for the operation. Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. Refer to [Specifying Permissions in a Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/specifying-permissions.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide for more details.\n  \n- **Object Data Format**: \n  - The object you want to query must be in **CSV** format.\n  - The encoding must be **UTF-8**.\n  - If the CSV file is compressed, it must use **GZIP** or **BZIP2** compression.\n  - The object can be protected with **server-side encryption**.\n\n### **2. Using the AWS CLI to Query CSV Data**\n\nYou can use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) to execute the `SelectObjectContent` operation. Below is a step-by-step example:\n\n#### **a. Construct the `select-object-content` Command**\n\nUse the following command structure to filter the contents of your CSV object based on an SQL statement:\n\n```bash\naws s3api select-object-content \\\n    --bucket your-bucket-name \\\n    --key your-data-file.csv \\\n    --expression \"SELECT * FROM S3Object LIMIT 100\" \\\n    --expression-type 'SQL' \\\n    --input-serialization '{\"CSV\": {\"FileHeaderInfo\": \"USE\"}, \"CompressionType\": \"NONE\"}' \\\n    --output-serialization '{\"CSV\": {}}' \\\n    output.csv\n```\n\n**Explanation of Parameters:**\n\n- `--bucket`: The name of your S3 bucket (e.g., `my-bucket`).\n  \n- `--key`: The key (path) to your CSV file in the bucket (e.g., `my-data-file.csv`).\n  \n- `--expression`: The SQL statement to execute against the CSV data. For example, `\"SELECT * FROM S3Object LIMIT 100\"` retrieves the first 100 records.\n  \n- `--expression-type`: Specify `'SQL'` to indicate that the expression is an SQL statement.\n  \n- `--input-serialization`: Defines the format of the input data. For a CSV file without compression:\n  \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"CSV\": {\n      \"FileHeaderInfo\": \"USE\"\n    },\n    \"CompressionType\": \"NONE\"\n  }\n  ```\n  \n  - If your CSV is compressed, set `\"CompressionType\"` to `\"GZIP\"` or `\"BZIP2\"`.\n  \n- `--output-serialization`: Defines the format of the output data. To receive the output in CSV format:\n  \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"CSV\": {}\n  }\n  ```\n  \n- `output.csv`: The file where the query results will be saved.\n\n#### **b. Execute the Command**\n\nRun the constructed command in your terminal. For example:\n\n```bash\naws s3api select-object-content \\\n    --bucket my-bucket \\\n    --key my-data-file.csv \\\n    --expression \"SELECT * FROM S3Object LIMIT 100\" \\\n    --expression-type 'SQL' \\\n    --input-serialization '{\"CSV\": {\"FileHeaderInfo\": \"USE\"}, \"CompressionType\": \"NONE\"}' \\\n    --output-serialization '{\"CSV\": {}}' \\\n    output.csv\n```\n\n**Note:** This command does not produce output in the terminal. Instead, the results are written to the specified `output.csv` file.\n\n### **3. Additional Considerations**\n\n- **Server-Side Encryption**: If your CSV file is encrypted using server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C), ensure you use HTTPS and include the necessary headers as documented in the [GetObject API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html).\n\n- **Unsupported Features**: \n  - The `SelectObjectContent` operation is not supported by directory buckets.\n  - Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.\n  - This functionality is not available for Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\n- **Further Information**: For more detailed API information, refer to [SelectObjectContent in AWS CLI Command Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/select-object-content.html) and [Selecting Content from Objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/selecting-content.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively use the `SelectObjectContent` API to query CSV data stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.",

Objects consist of object data and \nmetadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These pairs include \nsome default metadata, such as the date last modi\ufb01ed, and standard HTTP metadata, such as\nContent-Type . You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.\nAn object is uniquely identi\ufb01ed within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID (if S3 Versioning is \nenabled on the bucket). For more information about objects, see Amazon S3 objects overview.\nKeys\nAn object key  (or key name ) is the unique identi\ufb01er for an object within a bucket. Every object in a \nbucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if \nS3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object. So you can think of Amazon \nS3 as a basic data map between \"bucket + key + version\" and the object itself.\nEvery object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service \nendpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL https:// amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket .s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg , amzn-s3-demo-\nbucket is the name of the bucket and photos/puppy.jpg  is the key.\nFor more information about object keys, see Naming Amazon S3 objects.\nS3 Versioning\nYou can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. With S3 \nVersioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your \nbuckets. You can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.\nFor more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning.\nObjects API Version 2006-03-01 7",

With job tags, \nyou can control access to your Batch Operations jobs and enforce that tags be applied when any \njob is created.\nYou can apply up to 50 job tags to each Batch Operations job. By using tags, you can set granular \npolicies to restrict the set of users that can edit the job. Job tags can grant or limit a user\u2019s ability \nto cancel a job, activate a job in the con\ufb01rmation state, or change a job\u2019s priority level. In addition, \nyou can enforce that tags be applied to all new jobs, and specify the allowed key-value pairs for the \ntags. You can express all of these conditions by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) \npolicy language. For more information, see Actions, resources, and condition keys for Amazon S3 in \nthe Service Authorization Reference.\nFor more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see\nRequired permissions for Amazon S3 API operations.\nThe following example shows how you can use S3 Batch Operations job tags to grant users \npermission to create and edit only the jobs that are run within a speci\ufb01c department (for \nexample, the Finance or Compliance department). You can also assign jobs based on the stage of \ndevelopment that they are related to, such as QA or Production.\nIn this example, you use S3 Batch Operations job tags in IAM policies to grant users permission to \ncreate and edit only the jobs that are being run within their department.

When you perform these operations, you specify the bucket that \nyou want to use by including its name with the request. For example, to retrieve an object from S3, \nyou make a request that speci\ufb01es the name of a bucket and the object key to retrieve from that \nbucket.\nBecause Amazon S3 identi\ufb01es buckets based on their names, an application that uses an incorrect \nbucket name in a request could inadvertently perform operations against a di\ufb00erent bucket than \nexpected. To help avoid unintentional bucket interactions in situations like this, you can use bucket \nowner condition . Bucket owner condition enables you to verify that the target bucket is owned by \nthe expected AWS account, providing an additional layer of assurance that your S3 operations are \nhaving the e\ufb00ects you intend.\nTopics\n\u2022When to use bucket owner condition\n\u2022Verifying a bucket owner\n\u2022Examples\n\u2022Restrictions and limitations\nWhen to use bucket owner condition\nWe recommend using bucket owner condition whenever you perform a supported S3 operation \nand know the account ID of the expected bucket owner. Bucket owner condition is available for all \nS3 object operations and most S3 bucket operations. For a list of S3 operations that don't support \nbucket owner condition, see Restrictions and limitations.\nTo see the bene\ufb01t of using bucket owner condition, consider the following scenario involving AWS \ncustomer Bea:\n1.Bea develops an application that uses Amazon S3. During development, Bea uses her testing-\nonly AWS account to create a bucket named bea-data-test , and con\ufb01gures her application to \nmake requests to bea-data-test .\n2.Bea deploys her application, but forgets to recon\ufb01gure the application to use a bucket in her \nproduction AWS account.\n3.In production, Bea's application makes requests to bea-data-test , which succeed. This results \nin production data being written to the bucket in Bea's test account.\nWhen to use bucket owner condition API Version 2006-03-01 1241",

To access an archived \nobject, you must \ufb01rst initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived \nobject. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to \nexist. After the speci\ufb01ed period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains \narchived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from.\nTo restore a speci\ufb01c object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, \nAmazon S3 restores the current version.\nThe time it takes restore jobs to \ufb01nish depends on which storage class the object is being restored \nfrom and which data access tier you specify.\nWhen restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following \ndata access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:\n\u2022Expedited  - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER \nstorage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but \nthe largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically \nmade available within 1\u20135 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for \nExpedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity \nare not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.\n\u2022Standard  - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several \nhours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do \nnot specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the \nGLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage \nclass.\n\u2022Bulk - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier\u2019s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to \nretrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically \ncomplete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 \nhours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.\nFor more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited  data \naccess, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.\nYou can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed \nwhile it is in progress.

    "answer": "To address the issue of accessing a public bucket that is being flagged by IAM Access Analyzer for S3 due to public access warnings, follow these steps based on the provided context:\n\n1. **Determine the Necessity of Public Access:**\n   - **Assess Use Case:** Confirm whether public access to the S3 bucket is required for a specific and verified use case, such as static website hosting, public downloads, or cross-account sharing.\n   \n2. **Acknowledge and Record Intent for Public Access:**\n   - **Acknowledge Public Access:** If public access is essential, you should acknowledge and record your intent for the bucket to remain public. This can be done by archiving the findings related to the bucket in IAM Access Analyzer for S3.\n   - **Archive Findings:** Archiving the findings signals that the public access is intentional and supports your specific use case. This action helps in maintaining transparency and auditing purposes.\n\n3. **Configure Granular Access Permissions (If Needed):**\n   - **Drill Down into Permissions:** You can drill down into the bucket-level permission settings to configure more granular levels of access. This allows you to provide only the necessary permissions required for your use case, enhancing security.\n   \n4. **Ensure Application Functionality:**\n   - **Verify Application Requirements:** Before making any changes to public access settings, ensure that your applications will continue to function correctly without unintended public access. This step is crucial to prevent disruptions in your services.\n\n5. **Use IAM Access Analyzer Features:**\n   - **Block Public Access (If Not Required):** If, after assessment, you determine that public access is not necessary, you can block all public access to the bucket with a single click using the \"Block all public access\" button in IAM Access Analyzer for S3. This is recommended to enhance security by default.\n   - **Review and Modify Configurations:** You can revisit and modify these bucket configurations at any time based on evolving requirements.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - **Download Findings for Auditing:** For auditing purposes, you can download your findings as a CSV report to maintain records of your access configurations and any changes made.\n   - **Monitor Findings Status:** Keep an eye on the status of your findings (Active or Archived) to ensure that your access configurations align with your security and operational needs.\n\n**Summary:**\nIf public access to the S3 bucket is required for a legitimate purpose, acknowledge and record this intent by archiving the relevant findings in IAM Access Analyzer for S3. This action will allow the bucket to remain public while ensuring that the access is intentional and documented. Conversely, if public access is not necessary, use the IAM Access Analyzer for S3 console to block all public access to enhance security.",

    "question": "Walk through setting up a Multi-Region Access Point for an S3 bucket to handle cross-region traffic.",
    "answer": "To set up a **Multi-Region Access Point** for an Amazon S3 bucket to handle cross-region traffic, follow these detailed steps based solely on the provided context:\n\n### 1. Sign In to the AWS Management Console\n- **Access the S3 Console**: \n  - Navigate to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) by signing in to the AWS Management Console.\n\n### 2. Initiate the Creation of a Multi-Region Access Point\n- **Start the Creation Process**:\n  - In the S3 console, begin the process to create a new Multi-Region Access Point.\n\n### 3. Specify the Multi-Region Access Point Name\n- **Name Selection**:\n  - Provide a unique name for your Multi-Region Access Point. This name is used for management operations (e.g., `GetMultiRegionAccessPoint`, `PutMultiRegionAccessPointPolicy`) but is **not** used for client requests and does not need to be exposed to clients.\n\n### 4. Select Supported Regions and Associate Buckets\n- **Choose Supported Control Plane Regions**:\n  - Ensure that your requests are routed through one of the five supported Regions:\n    - **US East (N. Virginia)**\n    - **US West (Oregon)**\n    - **Asia Pacific (Sydney)**\n    - **Asia Pacific (Tokyo)**\n    - **Europe (Ireland)**\n  \n- **Associate Buckets in Supported AWS Regions**:\n  - Your Multi-Region Access Point can include buckets from the following Regions:\n    - **US Regions**: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), US West (Oregon)\n    - **Asia Pacific Regions**: Mumbai, Osaka, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo\n    - **Canada**: Canada (Central)\n    - **Europe Regions**: Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Paris, Stockholm\n    - **South America**: S\u00e3o Paulo\n  - **Rule**: Each Multi-Region Access Point must be associated with **exactly one bucket** in each selected Region.\n  - **Bucket Selection**: Specify the name of each bucket during the creation process. These buckets can belong to the same AWS account or different accounts.\n\n### 5. Configure Bucket Permissions (If Using Buckets from Other Accounts)\n- **Grant Access Permissions**:\n  - If you add a bucket owned by another account, the bucket owner must update their bucket policy to grant access permissions to the Multi-Region Access Point. Without this, the Access Point won't be able to retrieve data from that bucket.\n  - **Example**: Refer to \"Multi-Region Access Point policy examples\" for guidance on setting up appropriate bucket policies.\n\n### 6. Finalize the Creation of the Multi-Region Access Point\n- **Automatic Alias Assignment**:\n  - Amazon S3 will automatically assign a unique alias ending with `.mrap` to your Multi-Region Access Point. This alias is used to construct the hostname and ARN.\n  - **Note**: The alias is unique and cannot be changed. It does not expose the name, purpose, or owner of the Access Point.\n  \n- **Complete the Setup**:\n  - Review your configurations and complete the creation process. Remember that once created, you **cannot add, modify, or remove buckets** from the Multi-Region Access Point configuration. To make changes, you must delete the existing Access Point and create a new one with the desired configuration.\n\n### 7. (Optional) Configure Cross-Region Replication for Data Consistency\n- **Set Up Replication Rules**:\n  - To ensure that all associated buckets contain consistent datasets, configure **S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)**. This automatically synchronizes data between the source and destination buckets.\n  - **Recommendation**: Although Multi-Region Access Points handle request routing, setting up CRR ensures that the requested data is available in all associated buckets.\n\n### 8. Use the Multi-Region Access Point\n- **Routing Requests**:\n  - When a request is made through the Multi-Region Access Point\u2019s alias, Amazon S3 will direct the request to the bucket closest to the requester based on the associated Regions.\n  \n- **Managing the Access Point**:\n  - Use management operations such as `GetMultiRegionAccessPoint` and `PutMultiRegionAccessPointPolicy` to manage your Access Point as needed.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- **Deletion Constraints**:\n  - You cannot delete a bucket that is part of a Multi-Region Access Point unless you first delete the Access Point itself.\n  \n- **Alias Uniqueness**:\n  - Aliases are unique and cannot be reused. Even if you delete an Access Point and create a new one with the same name and configuration, the new Access Point will have a different alias.\n  \n- **Supported Regions**:\n  - Not all AWS Regions support Multi-Region Access Points. Ensure that you are selecting from the supported Regions listed above.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set up a Multi-Region Access Point to manage and route cross-region traffic for your Amazon S3 buckets, ensuring high availability and optimized access based on geographic proximity.",

    "question": "How does S3 Object Lock help meet regulatory compliance, and what are the prerequisites for enabling it?",
    "answer": "S3 Object Lock assists in meeting regulatory compliance by implementing a **write-once-read-many (WORM)** model for data storage. This ensures that objects stored in Amazon S3 cannot be deleted or overwritten for a specified retention period or indefinitely. By enforcing these restrictions, S3 Object Lock helps organizations comply with various data protection and retention regulations that require data immutability and preservation for audit, legal, or compliance purposes.\n\n### How S3 Object Lock Helps Meet Regulatory Compliance:\n\n1. **Data Immutability (WORM Model):**\n   - **Prevents Deletion and Overwrite:** Once an object is locked, it cannot be deleted or modified during the retention period. This immutability is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that records remain unchanged, which is often a requirement under regulations like SEC 17a-4, FINRA, and GDPR.\n   \n2. **Retention Periods and Legal Holds:**\n   - **Retention Periods:** Organizations can set a specific duration for which the data must remain immutable. This aligns with regulations that mandate data retention for a defined period.\n   - **Legal Holds:** In situations where data must be preserved beyond the standard retention period for legal reasons, legal holds can be applied to ensure that the data remains unaltered until the hold is lifted.\n\n3. **Compliance Auditing and Reporting:**\n   - **Object Lock Metrics:** Using S3 Storage Lens, organizations can monitor the percentage of Object Lock bytes across their accounts or organizations. This visibility ensures that data protection best practices are being followed and facilitates auditing processes.\n\n### Prerequisites for Enabling S3 Object Lock:\n\n1. **Enable S3 Versioning:**\n   - **Versioning Requirement:** Before enabling Object Lock, S3 Versioning must be enabled on the bucket. Versioning allows multiple variants of an object to be stored in the same bucket, which is essential for maintaining object histories and enforcing immutability.\n\n2. **Enable Object Lock on the Bucket:**\n   - **Bucket Configuration:** Object Lock can only be enabled when creating a new S3 bucket. It cannot be enabled on existing buckets. This setup ensures that the WORM model is applied from the onset of the bucket's lifecycle.\n   - **Irreversible Action:** Once Object Lock is enabled on a bucket, it cannot be disabled, and versioning cannot be suspended for that bucket. This permanence guarantees continuous compliance with data immutability requirements.\n\n3. **Set Retention Policies or Legal Holds:**\n   - **Retention Periods:** After enabling Object Lock, you must define retention periods for your objects. These periods dictate how long the objects remain immutable.\n   - **Legal Holds:** In addition to or instead of retention periods, legal holds can be applied to objects to prevent their modification or deletion as needed for legal compliance.\n\n4. **Appropriate Permissions:**\n   - **Permission Requirements:** To work with Object Lock, specific permissions are necessary. For example, permissions like `s3:GetObjectRetention` and `s3:GetObjectLegalHold` are required to view retention settings and legal hold statuses. Additionally, permissions like `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` are needed to perform certain operations under governance mode.\n\nBy adhering to these prerequisites and leveraging the features of S3 Object Lock, organizations can effectively enforce data immutability, ensuring compliance with various regulatory standards and safeguarding critical data against unauthorized modifications or deletions.",

Additionally, you can view the Object Lock \nstatus for multiple objects in your S3 bucket using S3 Inventory.\nTo view an object version's retention mode and retention period, you must have the\ns3:GetObjectRetention  permission.

These operations \ninclude deleting an object version, shortening the retention period, or removing the Object Lock \nretention period by placing a new PutObjectRetention  request with empty parameters.\nTo bypass governance mode, you must explicitly indicate in your request that you want to bypass \nthis mode. To do this, include the x-amz-bypass-governance-retention:true  header with \nyour PutObjectRetention  API operation request, or use the equivalent parameter with requests \nmade through the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs.

Objects consist of object data and \nmetadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These pairs include \nsome default metadata, such as the date last modi\ufb01ed, and standard HTTP metadata, such as\nContent-Type . You can also specify custom metadata at the time that the object is stored.\nAn object is uniquely identi\ufb01ed within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID (if S3 Versioning is \nenabled on the bucket). For more information about objects, see Amazon S3 objects overview.\nKeys\nAn object key  (or key name ) is the unique identi\ufb01er for an object within a bucket. Every object in a \nbucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, object key, and optionally, version ID (if \nS3 Versioning is enabled for the bucket) uniquely identify each object. So you can think of Amazon \nS3 as a basic data map between \"bucket + key + version\" and the object itself.\nEvery object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service \nendpoint, bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL https:// amzn-\ns3-demo-bucket .s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg , amzn-s3-demo-\nbucket is the name of the bucket and photos/puppy.jpg  is the key.\nFor more information about object keys, see Naming Amazon S3 objects.\nS3 Versioning\nYou can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. With S3 \nVersioning, you can preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your \nbuckets. You can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.\nFor more information, see Retaining multiple versions of objects with S3 Versioning.\nObjects API Version 2006-03-01 7",

S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the only cloud storage class that delivers automatic \ncost savings by moving data on a granular object level between access tiers when access patterns \nchange. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class when you want to optimize storage \ncosts for data that has unknown or changing access patterns. There are no retrieval fees for S3 \nIntelligent-Tiering.\nFor a small monthly object monitoring and automation fee, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access \npatterns and automatically moves objects that have not been accessed to lower-cost access tiers. \nS3 Intelligent-Tiering delivers automatic storage cost savings in three low-latency and high-\nthroughput access tiers. For data that can be accessed asynchronously, you can choose to activate \nautomatic archiving capabilities within the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class.
