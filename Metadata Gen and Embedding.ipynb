      "Response: Here are some common techniques for debugging memory leaks in C++:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Memory Leak Detection Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Valgrind:** A powerful tool that can detect memory leaks, invalid memory accesses, and other memory-related errors. Valgrind is highly effective but can be relatively slow. \n",
      "* **AddressSanitizer (ASan):** Built-in to modern compilers (clang and GCC), ASan is a fast and accurate memory leak detector.\n",
      "* **LeakSanitizer:** Similar to ASan, LeakSanitizer focuses specifically on detecting memory leaks. It's faster than ASan but provides less detailed information about the leak. \n",
      "* **MSVC Memory Leak Detector:** Included in Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC), this tool helps identify leaks in Windows applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Manual Debugging:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Use a debugger (e.g., gdb):** Step through your code line by line and inspect memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
      "* **Use `malloc_debug`:** This is a library function that can be used to track memory allocations and deallocations. It provides information about where memory was allocated and when it was freed.\n",
      "* **Set breakpoints at memory allocation and deallocation points:** This will allow you to track down the exact location where memory is being leaked.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Code Review and Best Practices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Always use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):**  Ensure that resources (like memory) are automatically released when an object goes out of scope. Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage dynamically allocated memory.\n",
      "* **Avoid manual memory management:**  Minimize the use of `new` and `delete` whenever possible. Prefer using containers like `std::vector` and `std::map` which handle memory management for you.\n",
      "* **Check for dangling pointers:**  Dangling pointers point to memory that has been deallocated. Make sure you are not using pointers after the memory they point to has been freed.\n",
      "* **Use `nullptr`:** Initialize pointers to `nullptr` to prevent accidental access to uninitialized memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Steps to Debug:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Run your program with a memory leak detector.**\n",
      "2. **Identify the location of the memory leak.**\n",
      "3. **Examine the code around the leak location.**\n",
      "4. **Fix the code to prevent the leak.**\n",
      "5. **Rerun your program with the leak detector to verify the fix.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```c++\n",
      "#include <iostream>\n",
      "\n",
      "int main() {\n",
      "  int* ptr = new int; // Memory leak: no delete\n",
      "  *ptr = 5;\n",
      "  std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;\n",
      "\n",
      "  return 0;\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix the leak:\n",
      "\n",
      "```c++\n",
      "#include <iostream>\n",
      "\n",
      "int main() {\n",
      "  int* ptr = new int; // Memory leak: no delete\n",

      "  return 0;\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
